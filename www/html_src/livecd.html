<h1>XORP Live CD</h1>

<p>
<h2>Quick notes:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Download and burn the
      <a href="http://www.candelatech.com/downloads.php#lfcd">LANforge Live-CD</a>
      Please note that you do NOT need LANforge licenses to just use LANforge and Xorp as (virtual)
      routers.  You may
      <a href="http://www.candelatech.com/cgi/cr_login.cgi">create an account on candelatech.com</a> or
      just use <pre>user:  guest  password: guest</pre> to log in to the downloads page. </li>
  <li>Boot it up.</li>
  <li>If you want to use XORP all by itself, it is installed in /usr/local/xorp.  You
      can create a config file and start it manually:  xorp_rtrmgr -b [cfg-file]</li>
  <li>Or, you can use LANforge to auto-create Xorp config files and manage XORP
      using the Netsmith feature.  See more instructions below if using this method.</li>
  <li>Profit!</li>
</ol>

<h2>Using LANforge and Netsmith to create XORP routers.</h2>
<P>
LANforge is a network testing tool produced by <a href="http://www.candelatech.com">Candela Technologies</a>.
It can be used for network traffic generation and network emulation (including latency,
packet loss, bandwidth-constriction, etc).  As part of its virtual-routing feature
set, it can manage XORP through its Netsmith GUI widget.  As long as you do not
attempt to generate traffic or add network impairment, you do not need any LANforge
licenses.
<P>
<ol>
  <li>After booting up the Live-CD, start LANforge and the LANforge-GUI by
      clicking on the icons on the desktop.</li>
  <li>
  <li>Click 'Netsmith' in the Status panel of the LANforge-GUI.  It will be
      towards the middle of the screen.</li>
  <li>In Netsmith, right-click to create a new Virtual Router and then
      drag network interfaces into the router to use them.  The Virtual Router
      has different routing options, including OSPF, BGP, etc.</li>
  <li>You may need to configure the Interfaces as well..right-click on the little
      green or black squares in Netsmith to modify them.</li>
  <li>You may optionally create additional virtual routers and connections between
      the virtual routers.  When creating connections, be sure to skip the 'B'
      ports and the WanLink, otherwise you will need LANforge-ICE emulation licenses
      for the WanLink to function.</li>
  <li>When satisfied, click Apply and XORP will be (re)started with the proper config.</li>
  <li>The xorp config files are saved in /home/lanforge/vr_conf/ and may be useful as
      a starting point for more advanced XORP configurations.</li>
  <li>You may wish to see some of the
      <a href="http://www.candelatech.com/lfgui_ice_cookbook.php">LANforge cookbook examples</a>
      for more details.  These examples are tailored to using LANforge, but the ones related to routing
      will be using XORP.</li>
