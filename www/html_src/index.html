<p>
XORP is the industry's only extensible open source routing platform.
XORP provides a fully featured platform that implements IPv4 and IPv6 routing
protocols and a unified platform to configure them.  It is the only
open source platform to offer integrated multicast capability.  XORP's
modular architecture allows rapid introduction of new protocols,
features and functionality, including support for custom hardware and
software forwarding.

<p>
March 2, 2011:  Ben Greear from
<a href="http://www.candelatech.com/">Candela Technologies</a>
 has been made the new project manager
for XORP.  His XORP.CT tree is now the official XORP code
base.  This officially 'un-forks' XORP and will allow
users and contributors to focus on a single code-base.
<P>
XORP 1.8.3 is Released

  <ul>
    <li>Change the way VLANs are created.  This changes the config
      file syntax (though the original syntax didn't actually work
      right..so probably no one is actually using it.)</li>

    <li>Re-add support for XORP on Microsoft Windows.  Add instructions
      to BUILD_NOTES for cross-compiling with mingw.</li>

    <li>Add more options for disabling compile of certain modules.
      See:  scons --help</li>

    <li>Add support for IPv6 multicast with virtual routing tables.
      Requires Linux kernel 2.6.35 or higher.</li>

    <li>Support cross-compiling.  See BUILD_NOTES.</li>

    <li>BSD:  Don't crash FEA when interface disappears.</li>

    <li>BSD:  Don't fail commit if cannot remove route that doesn't exist.</li>

    <li>Add signal handling for more graceful exit.  Helps clean up /var/tmp/xrl.*
      files and lets valgrind report more useful information.</li>

    <li>timers:  Fix memory leak related to the Heap class.</li>

    <li>BGP:  Fix up tear-down logic to make sure it exits promptly in
      all cases.</li>

    <li>pim: Fix a recursive delete issue in pim code, exposed by the ability to
      gracefully shut down processes with SIGTERM.</li>

    <li>rtrmgr:  Allow starting helper processes under valgrind.  Just
      create a file called XORP_USE_VALGRIND in the working directory.
      If you want xorp_rtrmgr to use valgrind, you have to start it under
      valgrind manually.</li>

    <li>FEA:  Properly clean up all sockets and remove them from the eventloop
      callback when cleaing up io_ip_socket objects.</li>

    <li>firewall:  Support compiling netlink firewall support on Linux, if
      kernel headers are properly modified to compile with c++.</li>

   <li>A more detailed change list list is in Release Notes
       available at <a href="releases/1.8.3/docs/RELEASE_NOTES">releases/1.8.3/docs/RELEASE_NOTES</a>
   </li>
  </ul>

<h2>Ongoing Development</h2>
<P>
Support for cross-compiling XORP to Microsoft
Windows using the mingw cross-compiler was
recently added.  The documentation was moved
to a wiki, and VLAN handling was re-worked.
Asynchronous XRL support should be coming sono.
