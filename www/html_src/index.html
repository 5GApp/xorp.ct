XORP is the industry's only extensible open source routing platform.
XORP provides a fully featured platform that implements IPv4 and IPv6 routing
protocols and a unified platform to configure them.  It is the only
open source platform to offer integrated multicast capability.  XORP's
modular architecture allows rapid introduction of new protocols,
features and functionality, including support for custom hardware and
software forwarding.

<p>
March 2, 2011:  Ben Greear from
<a href="http://www.candelatech.com/">Candela Technologies</a>
 has been made the new project manager
for XORP.  His XORP.CT tree is now the official XORP code
base.  This officially 'un-forks' XORP and will allow
users and contributors to focus on a single code-base.
<P>
Key features
of the 1.8-CT release are:

  <ul>
   <li>Allow OSPF, RIP, BGP, OSLR, and PIM to better handle interfaces
      being added to and deleted from a running xorp instance via the 'xorpsh' CLI tool.</li>

   <li>PIM: Fix state-machine lockup due to failure to advance state machine in some error cases.</li>

   <li>RIP, BGP, PIM: Allow binding the protocol sockets to specific interfaces.</li>

   <li>FEA: Support binding to specific interfaces, including multicast protocols.
      Use Netlink (Linux only) to filter events so that a single instance of
      xorp pays attention to only it's interfaces.</li>

   <li>FEA: Support new Linux kernel API to provide multiple multicast
     routing tables per kernel instance. This requires kernel 2.6.34
     and the latest iproute and iptable tools.  These changes are
     backwards compatible with normal kernels.</li>

   <li>OLSR: Enable building OLSR, support binding to a specific interface.</li>

   <li>Support building IPv6 multicast support on Linux.</li>

   <li>Re-enable Microsoft Windows support. IPv6 looks questionable,
       but it's likely IPv4 works good enough.</li>

   <li>A more detailed change list list is in Release Notes
       available at <a href="releases/1.8-CT/docs/RELEASE_NOTES">releases/1.8-CT/docs/RELEASE_NOTES</a>
   </li>
  </ul>

<h2>Ongoing Development</h2>
<P>
Support for cross-compiling XORP to Microsoft
Windows using the mingw cross-compiler was
recently added.  The documentation is being moved
to a wiki,
and there is an on-going effort to deal better with
802.1Q VLANs.  XORP 1.8.3 will be released when
VLANS have been resolved, hopefully by end of March,
2011.
