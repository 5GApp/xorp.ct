XORP is the industry's only extensible open source routing platform.
XORP provides a fully featured platform that implements IPv4 and IPv6 routing
protocols and a unified platform to configure them.  It is the only
open source platform to offer integrated multicast capability.  XORP's
modular architecture allows rapid introduction of new protocols,
features and functionality, including support for custom hardware and
software forwarding.

XORP 1.8.4 is Released

  <ul>
    <li>Async XRL support from Steven Simpson.</li>

    <li>Fix bug when deleting non-VLAN interfaces.  Commit would fail
       because the code would attempt to remove the interface from
       the kernel and fail.</li>

    <li>Fix BSD related crash when adding interface with same ifindex
      as a previous interface.  OpenBSD has the nasty habit of re-using
      the ifindex when creating/deleting virtual interfaces.</li>

    <li>Fix multicast bug that totally breaks XORP multicast on recent
      Linux kernels.  The problem is that I chose the wrong default
      multicast routing table (254, instead of 253 as it should be).
      So, if users don't specify a routing table, it pokes routes into
      the wrong table.  This wasn't caught in my testing because I always
      explicitly set the routing table ID.</li>

    <li>Add some env variable controlled debugging to the libxorp and libxipc
      logic for better debugging of xrls and the event loop.</li>

   <li>A more detailed change list list is in Release Notes
       available at <a href="releases/1.8.4/docs/RELEASE_NOTES">releases/1.8.4/docs/RELEASE_NOTES</a>
   </li>
  </ul>
