XORP is the industry's only extensible open source routing platform.
XORP provides a fully featured platform that implements IPv4 and IPv6 routing
protocols and a unified platform to configure them.  It is the only
open source platform to offer integrated multicast capability.  XORP's
modular architecture allows rapid introduction of new protocols,
features and functionality, including support for custom hardware and
software forwarding.

<p>
We are pleased to announce release 1.8-CT of the XORP codebase.  XORP.CT is
a continuation of the XORP project that is managed by Ben Greear from
<a href="http://www.candelatech.com/">Candela Technologies</a>.  The goal
of the XORP.CT branch is to add features related to virtualizing XORP
so that multiple instances can run on a single OS.  Each Xorp instance
will be able to utilize a specific subset of interfaces and ignore the
rest.  XORP.CT will continue function fine as a normal non-virtualized router
as well.  We will also strive to incorporate work that others are doing with
XORP in a more responsive manner.
<P>
Key features
of the 1.8-CT release are:

  <ul>
   <li>Allow OSPF, RIP, BGP, OSLR, and PIM to better handle interfaces
      being added to and deleted from a running xorp instance via the 'xorpsh' CLI tool.</li>

   <li>PIM: Fix state-machine lockup due to failure to advance state machine in some error cases.</li>

   <li>RIP, BGP, PIM: Allow binding the protocol sockets to specific interfaces.</li>

   <li>FEA: Support binding to specific interfaces, including multicast protocols.
      Use Netlink (Linux only) to filter events so that a single instance of
      xorp pays attention to only it's interfaces.</li>

   <li>FEA: Support new Linux kernel API to provide multiple multicast
     routing tables per kernel instance. This requires kernel 2.6.34
     and the latest iproute and iptable tools.  These changes are
     backwards compatible with normal kernels.</li>

   <li>OLSR: Enable building OLSR, support binding to a specific interface.</li>

   <li>Support building IPv6 multicast support on Linux. Haven't tested functionality yet.</li>

   <li>A more detailed change list list is in Release Notes
       available at <a href="releases/1.8-CT/docs/RELEASE_NOTES">releases/1.8-CT/docs/RELEASE_NOTES</a>
   </li>
  </ul>
