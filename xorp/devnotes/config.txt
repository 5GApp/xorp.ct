Options for XORP Configuration


What's the problem?

 - need to have startup configuration for all the daemons stored somewhere.

   + some of the startup config needs to be shared (eg interface list).

 - want to be able to change the config of daemons on the fly via CLI, 
   SNMP or whatever.

   + some of these changes need to be shared (eg bringing up an interface)

   + would like to be able to look somewhere and see the current config

   + need to be able to save these changes so the router comes up in 
     this state next time

 - some of the daemons are written (or modified) by us; some are not.
