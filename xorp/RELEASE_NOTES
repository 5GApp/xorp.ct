		XORP RELEASE NOTES

This file contains XORP release notes (most recent releases first).


Release 1.8.4

   *  Add async-XRL support, from Steven Simpson

   *  Fix bug in deleting non-VLAN interface.  Commit would fail
      because the code would attempt to remove the interface from
      the kernel and fail.

   *  Fix BSD related crash when adding interface with same ifindex
      as a previous interface.  OpenBSD has the nasty habit of re-using
      the ifindex when creating/deleting virtual interfaces.

   *  Fix multicast bug that totally breaks XORP multicast on recent
      Linux kernels.  The problem is that I chose the wrong default
      multicast routing table (254, instead of 253 as it should be).
      So, if users don't specify a routing table, it pokes routes into
      the wrong table.  This wasn't caught in my testing because I always
      explicitly set the routing table ID.

Release 1.8.3 (March 16, 2011)

   *  Change the way VLANs are created.  This changes the config
      file syntax (though the original syntax didn't actually work
      right..so probably no one is actually using it.)

   *  Re-add support for XORP on Microsoft Windows.  Add instructions
      to BUILD_NOTES for cross-compiling with mingw.

   *  Add more options for disabling compile of certain modules.
      See:  scons --help

   *  Add support for IPv6 multicast with virtual routing tables.
      Requires Linux kernel 2.6.35 or higher.

   *  Support compiling with clang + llvm compiler:
      Install latest clang and llvm from their SVN repositories and:
      scons CC=clang CXX=clang++

   *  Add some changes to make it easier to support uSTL, but it does not
      actually work as uSTL had too many limitations and bugs, and didn't seem
      to gain much space improvements anyway.
      See BUILD_NOTES for more info.

   *  Support cross-compiling.  See BUILD_NOTES.

   *  BSD:  Don't crash FEA when interface disappears.

   *  BSD:  Don't fail commit if cannot remove route that doesn't exist.

   *  Add signal handling for more graceful exit.  Helps clean up /var/tmp/xrl.*
      files and lets valgrind report more useful information.

   *  timers:  Fix memory leak related to the Heap class.

   *  BGP:  Fix up tear-down logic to make sure it exits promptly in
      all cases.

   *  pim: Fix a recursive delete issue in pim code, exposed by the ability to
      gracefully shut down processes with SIGTERM.

   *  rtrmgr:  Allow starting helper processes under valgrind.  Just
      create a file called XORP_USE_VALGRIND in the working directory.
      If you want xorp_rtrmgr to use valgrind, you have to start it under
      valgrind manually.

   *  FEA:  Properly clean up all sockets and remove them from the eventloop
      callback when cleaing up io_ip_socket objects.

   *  firewall:  Support compiling netlink firewall support on Linux, if
      kernel headers are properly modified to compile with c++.

Release 1.8-CT  June, 2010

Overview:

Merge xorp.ct changes from Ben's private tree into upstream 1.7.

Major changes include:

   * Allow OSPF, RIP, BGP, OSLR, and PIM to better handle interfaces
      being added to and deleted from a running xorp instance via the 'xorpsh' CLI tool.

   * PIM: Fix state-machine lockup due to failure to advance state machine in some error cases.

   * RIP, BGP, PIM: Allow binding the protocol sockets to specific interfaces.

   * FEA: Support binding to specific interfaces, including multicast protocols.
      Use Netlink (Linux only) to filter events so that a single instance of
      xorp pays attention to only it's interfaces.

   * FEA: Support new Linux kernel API to provide multiple multicast
     routing tables per kernel instance. This requires kernel 2.6.34
     and the latest iproute and iptable tools.  These changes are
     backwards compatible with normal kernels.

   * OLSR: Enable building OLSR, support binding to a specific interface.

   * Support building IPv6 multicast support on Linux. Haven't tested functionality yet.

Release 1.7  May 1, 2010
============================
  ALL:
    - Compiles on Linux (x86-32, x86-64, Sparc, at least) and BSD variants.
    - Replaced 'make' build system with 'scons'
    - New installation layout.
    - Footprint reduction.
    - Bug fixes here an there, more queued for release 1.8.
    - Support shared libraries.

  OLSR:
    - Currently broken in 1.7

  SNMP:
    - Removed


Release 1.6 (2009/01/07)
============================
  ALL:
    - XORP now builds on Linux CentOS 5.2, Linux openSUSE-11.0,
      Linux Debian-5.0 (lenny, unreleased), Linux Ubuntu 8.10,
      Linux Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 5 (Tikanga),
      Linux Fedora 10, and OpenBSD-4.4.

    - XORP now builds on Linux systems with kernel 2.6.26 which is the
      first one to support IPv6 multicast routing.

  CONFIGURATION:
    - If a PIM-SM router is suppose to receive and process the PIM-SM
      Bootstrap messages, the configuration must have the "bootstrap {}"
      block included (even if it is empty):

      protocols {
          pimsm4 {
              bootstrap {
              }
          }
      }

      protocols {
          pimsm6 {
              bootstrap {
              }
          }
      }

      Previously, the Bootstrap messages were unconditionally processed
      even if the "bootstrap {}" block contained "disable: true"
      statement.

    - The following CLI operational command prefix has been changed:
      OLD: "show route admin distances"

      they need to be on different interfaces and different LANs for correct
      behavior (see ERRATA).

    - The following master failure modes have been tested and are known to work
      (i.e., backup becomes master): bringing the master's interface down,
      rebooting / crashing the master, physically removing the network cable.
      Note that in the latter case the master may fail to resume operations
      when the cable is restored (see ERRATA).

    - Successfully interoperates with vrrpd.

Release 1.5 (2008/07/22)
========================
  ALL:
    - XORP now builds on DragonFlyBSD-1.10.1, DragonFlyBSD-1.12.2,
      FreeBSD-7.0, Linux Debian-4.0 (etch), Linux Fedora 7,
      Linux Fedora 8, Linux Fedora 9, Linux Gentoo 2008.0,
      Linux Ubuntu-7.04, Linux Ubuntu-7.10, Linux Ubuntu-8.04.1,
      NetBSD-4.0, OpenBSD-4.1, OpenBSD-4.2, OpenBSD-4.3, Mac OS X 10.5.2,
      Mac OS 10.5.3, and Mac OS X 10.5.4.

  CONFIGURATION:
    - Addition of new FEA configuration statements to set the IPv4/IPv6
      unicast forwarding table IDs:

      fea {
          unicast-forwarding4 {
              table-id: 254
          }
          unicast-forwarding6 {
              table-id: 254
          }
      }

      If the table ID is not configured, the FEA will use the default
      table ID for the system.
      Note that not all systems support multiple forwarding tables.
      Currently, they exist only on Linux (among all systems supported by
      XORP).

    - The "DISCARD" network interface flag is printed as appropriate
      when displaying the list of interfaces in the CLI.

    - Addition of new FEA configuration statement to support
      "unreachable" interfaces. Such interfaces are similar to "discard"
      interfaces, except that instead of silently throwing away packets,
      the system will respond with "ICMP destination unreachable".

      interfaces {
          interface my_unreachable {
              unreachable: true
              vif my_unreachable {
              }
          }
      }

      The default value for the "unreachable" statement is false.

    - Addition of new FEA configuration statement to flag an interface
      for "management" purpose. An interface that is flagged as
      "management" might be used in the future by some of the protocols
      for protocol-specific purpose.

      interfaces {
          interface fxp0 {
              management: true
              vif fxp0 {
                  address 10.10.10.10 {
                      prefix-length: 24
                  }
              }
          }
      }

      The default value for the "management" statement is false.

    - Addition of support to configure VLANs on an interface.
      A VLAN is configured by using a "vlan" block that includes
      the VLAN ID:

      interfaces {
          interface fxp0 {
              vif fxp0 {
                  address 10.10.10.10 {
                      prefix-length: 24
                  }
              }
              vif vlan1 {
                  vlan {
                      vlan-id: 1
                  }
                  address 10.10.20.20 {
                      prefix-length: 24
                  }
              }
          }
      }

    - Addition of preliminary support to configure firewall rules.
      Firewall rules are configured by using numbered entries:

      firewall {
          rule4 100 {
              action: "drop"
              protocol: 6		/* TCP */
              source {
                  interface: "fxp0"
                  vif: "fxp0"
                  network: 0.0.0.0/0
                  port-begin: 0
                  port-end: 65535
              }
              destination {
                  network: 10.10.0.0/24
                  port-begin: 0
                  port-end: 1024
              }
          }
      }
      Note that compiling firewall support on Linux systems require
      patching some of the system header files. See ERRATA for details.

    - The following PIM-SM configuration statements have been deprecated,
      because PIM-SM doesn't use Router Alert IP option anymore:

      protocols {
          pimsm4 {
              interface foo {
                  vif foo {
                      enable-ip-router-alert-option-check: true
                  }
              }
          }
      }

      protocols {
          pimsm6 {
              interface foo {
                  vif foo {
                      enable-ip-router-alert-option-check: true
                  }
              }
          }
      }

  LIBXORP:
    - The local system-independent xorp_random() implemenation is used
      instead of the random(3) provided by the system.

    - Improved MAC address support (classes Mac and EtherMac).

    - More consistent usage of XORP_OK and XORP_ERROR to return error
      codes.

  LIBXIPC:
    - Bug fix in the internal mechanism for obtaining the IPv4 addresses
      from the system. After the bug fix, a secondary (alias) IP address
      can be specified with the "-i <addr>" command-line option to
      the xorp_rtrmgr or xorp_finder binaries.

  LIBFEACLIENT:
    - No significant changes.

  XRL:
    - Critical bug fix that can be triggered by malformatted XRLs.

    - Addition of support for 64-bit integers: i64 and u64 for
      signed and unsigned respectively.

  RTRMGR:
    - Addition of preliminary mechanism to log events to a file or
      to a syslog facility.

    - Addition of support to run XORP in background (in daemon mode).

  XORPSH:
    - Bug fix related to assigning the node ID position in case the
      previous (sibling) node was deleted at the same time a new node
      was added.
      This fixes "Found out-of-order term(s) inside policy ..." error
      inside the policy manager.

    - The "-c <cmd>" command line option can be used more than once to
      run multiple commands.

    - Fix a long configuration delay when using xorpsh in
      non-interactive mode (e.g., "cat commands.txt | xorpsh").

    - Addition of a new "-e" command line option. It can be used to tell
      xorpsh to exit immediately if the connection to the Finder fails.

  POLICY:
    - No significant changes.

  FEA/MFEA:
    - Major refactoring of the FEA/MFEA internals.

    - Critical bug fix that affects recent NetBSD and OpenBSD releases.

    - Critical IPv6-related bug fix when adding unicast forwarding
      entries to the kernel. This bug was exposed only on *BSD systems
      with 64-bit CPU.

    - If MFEA is started, it will explicitly enable the multicast
      forwarding flags that have been added to recent OpenBSD releases:
      net.inet.ip.mforwarding (for OpenBSD-3.9 and later) and
      net.inet6.ip6.mforwarding (for OpenBSD-4.0 and later).

  RIB:
    - No significant changes.

  RIP/RIPng:
    - Addition of support for "show ripng" xorpsh operational commands.

    - Critical RIPng-related bug fix. Previously the RIPng installed
      routes had incorrect outgoing interface toward the destination.

    - Bug fix related to the TTL for RIPng multicast packets: now it is
      set to 255 as specified in the protocol specification (RFC 2080)
      instead of 1.

  OLSR:
    - Added support for RFC 3626 Optimized Link State Routing Protocol.
      This is a fully fledged XORP routing process with policy route
      redistribution capability. The work was generously funded over
      2007/2008 by CenGen, Inc.

  OSPF:
    - Bug fix related to OSPFv3 link-local scope LSAs. Previously the
      link-local scope LSAs were incorrectly flooded to links other
      than the one they belonged to.

    - Bug fix related to OSPFv3 Inter-Area-Prefix-LSAs. The check for
      the minimum size of an Inter-Area-Prefix-LSA was incorrect so
      short prefixes such as the default route would be rejected.

    - Added a clear database command.

    - In the OSPFv2 configuration "passive" is no longer a bool but a
      directive. Previously setting an interface to passive would set
      the interface to loopback and announce a host route for the
      interface. Using the passive keyword will still set the
      interface to loopback but now the network will be announced. If
      the previous behaviour of of announcing the host route is
      required the host variable can be set to true.

  BGP:
    - Added support for 4-byte AS numbers, as detailed in RFC 4893.
      From 1st Jan 2009 4-byte AS numbers will be allocated by default
      by RIPE, so it is desirable that all BGP implementations support
      four-byte AS numbers by that time.  Currently 4-byte support is
      not enabled in XORP by default, but can be enabled using the
      "enable-4byte-as-numbers" configuration option.

  STATIC_ROUTES:
    - Bug fix that prevented the deletion of interface-specific routes
      using xorpsh.

  MLD/IGMP:
    - No significant changes.

  MLD/IGMP-Lite:
    - An implementation of Lightweight IGMP/MLD is available in
      directory ${XORP}/contrib/mld6igmp_lite. It can be used instead
      of the existing MLD/IGMP vanilla implementation by using the
      following command before compiling XORP:
        ./configure --with-mld6igmp_lite

  PIM-SM:
    - No significant changes.

  FIB2MRIB:
    - No significant changes.

  CLI:
    - No significant changes.

  SNMP:
    - No significant changes.

Release 1.4 (2007/03/20)
=========================
  ALL:
    - XORP now builds on DragonFlyBSD-1.8, FreeBSD-6.2, Linux Fedora
      Core6, Linux Debian-3.1 (sarge), NetBSD-3.1 and OpenBSD-4.0.

    - XORP now can be compiled with the Intel C/C++ compiler 9.* on
      Linux.

    - XORP now can be cross-compiled for IA-64, MIPS (Broadcom for
      Linksys WRT54G), PowerPC-603, Sparc64, and XScale processors.

    - Implementation of OSPFv3 (draft-ietf-ospf-ospfv3-update-23.txt).

    - Implementation of floating static routes (i.e., static routes
      for the same prefix with different next hop and metrics).

  CONFIGURATION:
    - Allow static routes to have "nexthop4" and "nexthop6" policy
      matching conditions in the "from" block.

    - Addition of new FEA configuration statements to retain XORP
      unicast forwarding entries on startup or shutdown:

      fea {
          unicast-forwarding4 {
              forwarding-entries {
                  retain-on-startup: false
                  retain-on-shutdown: false
              }
          }
          unicast-forwarding6 {
              forwarding-entries {
                  retain-on-startup: false
                  retain-on-shutdown: false
              }
          }
      }

      The default value for each statement is false.
      Note that those statements prevent the FEA itself from deleting
      the forwarding entries and does not prevent the RIB or any of the
      unicast routing protocols from deleting the entries on shutdown.

    - The "elements" policy statements for configuring sets of network
      routes have been deprecated:

      policy {
          network4-list foo {
              elements: "1.2.0.0/16,3.4.0.0/16"
          }
          network6-list bar {
              elements: "2222::/64,3333::/64"
          }
      }

      The new replacement statement is "network" and can be used to
      specify one element per line:

      policy {
          network4-list foo {
              network 1.2.0.0/16
              network 3.4.0.0/16
          }
          network6-list bar {
              network 2222::/64
              network 3333::/64
          }
      }

    - The following keywords are supported inside the policy
      configuration when comparing IPv4 or IPv6 network prefixes:
      exact, longer, orlonger, shorter, orshorter, not. For example:

      "network4 exact 10.0.0.0/8"     SAME AS "network4 == 10.0.0.0/8"
      "network4 longer 10.0.0.0/8"    SAME AS "network4 < 10.0.0.0/8"
      "network4 orlonger 10.0.0.0/8"  SAME AS "network4 <= 10.0.0.0/8"
      "network4 shorter 10.0.0.0/8"   SAME AS "network4 > 10.0.0.0/8"
      "network4 orshorter 10.0.0.0/8" SAME AS "network4 >= 10.0.0.0/8"
      "network4 not 10.0.0.0/8"       SAME AS "network4 != 10.0.0.0/8"

      The original operators are supported as well.

    - A floating static route (also called "qualified" by some router
      vendors) can be added with a configuration like:

      protocols {
          static {
              route 10.10.0.0/16 {
                  next-hop: 172.16.0.1
                  metric: 1
                  qualified-next-hop 172.17.0.2 {
                      metric: 10
                  }
              }
              interface-route 10.30.30.0/24 {
                  next-hop-interface: "rl0"
                  next-hop-vif: "rl0"
                  next-hop-router: 172.16.0.1
                  metric: 1
                  qualified-next-hop-interface rl1 {
                      qualified-next-hop-vif rl1 {
                          next-hop-router: 172.17.0.2
                          metric: 10
                      }
                  }
              }
          }
      }

  LIBXORP:
    - The XORP scheduler now has support for priority-based tasks.

  LIBXIPC:
    - No significant changes.

  LIBFEACLIENT:
    - No significant changes.

  XRL:
    - No significant changes.

  RTRMGR:
    - Bug fix in the semantics of the rtrmgr template %activate keyword.

  XORPSH:
    - No significant changes.

  POLICY:
    - Bug fix related to creating export policies that match protocol's
      its own routes (e.g., a policy that modifies the BGP routes
      exported to its peers).

    - Various other bug fixes.

  FEA/MFEA:
    - Fix the routing socket based mechanism (used by BSD-derived
      systems) for obtaining the interface name (toward the destination)
      for a routing entry.

    - Apply a performance improvement when configuring a large number of
      interfaces/VIFs, each of them with the "default-system-config"
      configuration statement.

    - Bug fix related to atomically modifying the IP address of an interface.

  RIB:
    - Bug fix related to (not) installing redundant host-specific
      entries for the other side of a point-to-point interface if the
      netmask for the interface covers the host-specific entry.

  RIP/RIPng:
    - No significant changes.

  OSPF:
    - OSPFv3 is now available.

    - The OSPFv3 protocol requires that link-local addresses are used,
      therefore it is necessary to configure a link-local address for
      each interface, this restriction will be removed in the future.

    - The OSPFv3 configuration allows multiple instances to be configured
      however only one instance will be created. Configuring multiple
      OSPFv3 instances is guaranteed to cause problems.

    - Bug fix related to the processing of previously generated LSAs
      on startup has been fixed. Restarting a router that was the
      designated router could exhibit this problem.
      
    - Bug fix on a broadcast interface if the router was not the
      designated router then the nexthop was incorrectly
      unconditionally set to the designated router; introducing an
      unnecessary extra hop.

  BGP:
    - BGP has taken advantage of the priority-based tasks in the XORP
      scheduler and background tasks are run at a low priority;
      leading to improved performance.

  STATIC_ROUTES:
    - Bug fix related to declaring some of the policy matching
      conditions in the "from" block.

  MLD/IGMP:
    - Bug fix related to atomically modifying the IP address of an
      interface.

    - Bug fix related to ignoring protocol messages that are not
      recognized by the configured protocol version on an interface.

    - Ignore control messages if the source address is not directly
      connected.

    - Don't send the periodic Group-Specific or Group-and-Source-Specific
      Queries for entries that are in IGMPv1 mode.

  PIM-SM:
    - Bug fix related to atomically modifying the IP address of an
      interface.

    - The PIM-SM control messages do not include the IP Router Alert
      option anymore, because it has been included from the newer
      revisions of the PIM-SM protocol specification (RFC 4601 and
      draft-ietf-pim-sm-bsr-09.txt,.ps).

    - Don't send PIM Hello message with DR Priority of 0 when shutting
      down an interface, because this is not part of the protocol
      specification.

  FIB2MRIB:
    - Bug fix related to updating the interface and vif name of a
      forwarding entry received from the FEA.

  CLI:
    - Performance improvement if the CLI is processing a large amount
      of data. E.g., if xorpsh is used in a pipe like:

      cat commands.txt | xorpsh

  SNMP:
    - Bug fix with the snmpd arguments when sampling whether snmpd
      can start and its version is >= 5.2.

Release 1.3 (2006/08/02)
=========================
  ALL:
    - Numerous improvements, bug fixes and cleanup.

    - XORP now builds on Linux Fedora Core5, DragonFlyBSD-1.4,
      FreeBSD-6.1.

    - Implementation of IGMPv3 (RFC 3376) and MLDv2 (RFC 3810).
      Those are necessary to complete the Source-Specific Multicast
      support.

  CONFIGURATION:
    - Addition of new OSPF configuration statement as part of the MD5
      keys:

      * max-time-drift: u32 (default to 3600, i.e., 1 hour)

      It is used to set the maximum time drift (in seconds) among all
      OSPF routers. The allowed values are in the range [0--65535]. If
      the value is 65535, the time drift is unlimited.

    - The following statements for configuring static routes have been
      deprecated:
      route4, route6, interface-route4, interface-route6, mrib-route4,
      mrib-route6, mrib-interface-route4, mrib-interface-route6.

      The new replacement statements are:
      route, interface-route, mrib-route, mrib-interface-route.

      Each of the new statements can be used to configure either IPv4Net
      or IPv6Net route.

    - The following statements for configuring RIP and RIPng have been
      renamed:

      * route-expiry-secs -> route-timeout

      * route-deletion-secs -> deletion-delay

      * table-request-secs -> request-interval

      * interpacket-delay-msecs -> interpacket-delay

    - The following statements for configuring RIP and RIPng random
      intervals have been replaced:

      * triggered-update-min-secs and triggered-update-max-secs with
        triggered-delay and triggered-jitter

      * table-announce-min-secs and table-announce-max-secs with
        update-interval and update-jitter

      Previously, each interval was specified as [foo-min, foo-max].
      Now each interval is specified as
      [foo - foo * jitter / 100, foo + foo * jitter / 100]
      where "jitter" is specified as a percentage (an integer in the
      interval [0, 100]) of the value of "foo".

    - The "version" statement for configuring an IGMP interface/vif
      allows values in the range [1-3]. Previously, the allowed range
      was [1-2].

    - The "version" statement for configuring a MLD interface/vif allows
      values in the range [1-2]. Previously, the allowed range was [1-1].

    - The following statement for configuring PIM-SM (pimsm4 and pimsm6)
      has been renamed:

      interval-sec -> interval

    - If a "then" policy block contains "accept" or "reject" statement,
      now all statements inside the "then" block are evaluated
      regardless of their position.

    - Addition of a new "exit" operational mode command that is
      equivalent to the "quit" operational mode command.

    - The "create" and "set" configuration commands are merged, so now
      the new "set" command can be used for setting values and for
      creating new configuration nodes. For backward compatibility,
      the obsoleted "create" command is preserved as an alias for the
      new "set" command, though it may be removed in the future.

      reachable unicast address.

    - Resend some of the XRLs (e.g., those who do not carry soft-state
      such as protocol control messages) if there is an error.

    - Several bug fixes.

  FIB2MRIB:
    - This is a new module for propagating the unicast forwarding information
      obtained from the underlying system via the FEA to the multicast RIB.

  CLI:
    - Addition of support to propagate command interruption (e.g., Ctrl-C)
      from the CLI to the object that handles the command processing
      by calling a pre-defined callback.

    - During startup, if the input is a terminal (e.g., xorpsh), then
      read the terminal size instead of using the default values.

    - A bug fix related to the CLI paging output: now it can handle properly
      lines that are longer than the width of the CLI output terminal.

    - Several other bug fixes.

  SNMP:
    - No significant changes.


Release 0.5 (2003/11/06)
========================
  ALL:
    - New library libfeaclient to simplify interface configuration
      replication and event reception.

  LIBXORP:
    - Addition of ServiceBase class (service.hh) for asynchronous
      process components that might provide a service.  The
      ServiceBase contains status information, (e.g. starting,
      running, shutting down, shutdown) and methods for triggering
      status changes (e.g.start, shutdown).  It also provides an
      interface for observers to be notified of state changes.

    - Addition of ctype(3) wrappers that work properly even if the
      value of the int argument is not representable as an unsigned
      char and doesn't have the value of EOF.

  LIBXIPC:
    - Minor refactoring and code clean-up.

    - Fixes to XrlAtom binary marshalling methods and test code for
      checking this functionality in future.

  LIBFEACLIENT:
    - Added to project.  Provides interface configuration tree
      mirroring and update event notification.  Intended to unify how
      this data is replicated between processes.

  XRL:
    - kdoc generation nits.

  RTRMGR:
    - Fix the process name of a started proces to be the same
      as the binary name.

    - Minor code cleanup.

  XORPSH:
    - No significant changes.

  FEA/MFEA:
    - Added Linux Netlink support for writing network interface information,
      and routing entries to the kernel, and for observing the change of
      that information in the kernel.

    - Completed support for Linux /proc parsing to return network interface
      information.

    - Added support for NetBSD and OpenBSD to the unicast FEA.

    - Added compilation-time check whether the underlying system
      supports IPv6 multicast and IPv6 multicast routing, and isolate
      the compilation of all MFEA code that is specific to IPv6 multicast
      and IPv6 multicast routing.

    - Added support for run-time check whether the underlying system
      supports IPv4 or IPv6 multicast routing.

    - Various bug fixes and cleanup

  RIB:
    - No significant changes.

  BGP:
    - Supports multiprotocol IPv6.

    - The code for multicast SAFI is enabled but is untested.

    - MED processing is now deterministic.

    - A memory leak exists.

  MLD/IGMP:
    - No significant changes.

  PIM-SM:
    - A bug fix related to the removal of timed-out multicast forwarding
      entries.

  CLI:
    - Change slightly the command-line editing, so now Ctrl-W deletes
      the word before the cursor. Before, Ctrl-W would delete the
      whole line.

    - Apply a fix to libtecla in network mode such that
      keyboard-generated signals are not propagated to the process
      we have connected to.

  SNMP:
    - No significant changes.

  RIP/RIPng:
    - Code added to talk to FEA and RIB.  To become functional it
      still requires the ability to send packets and receive UDP
      packets through the FEA (work in progress).

Release 0.4 (2003/08/28)
========================
  ALL:
    - Rename all process names from "foo" to "xorp_foo":
      bgp -> xorp_bgp
      fea -> xorp_fea
      fea_dummy -> xorp_fea_dummy
      finder -> xorp_finder
      ospfd -> xorp_ospf
      rib -> xorp_rib
      rtrmgr -> xorp_rtrmgr

    - Added support for "gmake install" that installs the required
      XORP pieces under /usr/local/xorp.
      Currently, the installed subdirectories and files follow
      the organization in the XORP source code tree.
      Only the following binaries are installed in subdirectory "bin":
      call_xrl, xorp_rtrmgr, xorpsh.

    - Removed old directory "mfea", because it is not needed anymore
      (all the MFEA code has been merged with the FEA).

    - The code does not compile anymore on MacOS X 10.2.x (or earlier),
      due to compiler issues. After Apple starts distributing a better
      compiler (probably with MacOS X 10.3.x?), then attempt will be
      made to keep the code compiling again on MacOS X.

  LIBXORP:
    - Added pre-order iterators for Trie and RefTrie.

  LIBXIPC:
    - Addition of virtual methods in XrlRouter to provide processes with
      an opportunity to detect finder connection, registration, and
      disconnection events.

  XRL:
    - Minor changes to clnt-gen that changes the names of some typedefs.

  RTRMGR:
    - Now all relative paths to templates, xrl files, configuration
      files, etc are computed relative to the root of the XORP tree.
      The root is computed in the following order:
      1. The shell environment XORP_ROOT (if exists).
      2. The parent directory the rtrmgr is run from
         (only if it contains the etc/templates and the xrl/targets
         directories).
      3. The XORP_ROOT value as defined in config.h (currently this is
         the installation directory, and it defaults to /usr/local/xorp).

  XORPSH:
    - Now all relative paths to executable commands are computed
      relative to the root of the XORP tree. The root is computed
      similar to the rtrmgr root (see above), except that in step (2)
      we consider the parent directory the xorpsh is run instead.

  FEA/MFEA:
    - Bug fix: if the multicast protocol to start/stop is PIM, then start/stop
      PIM multicast routing in the kernel.

    - Bug fix (Linux-specific): if IGMP/MLD is enabled, then the multicast
      router will properly receive all IGMP/MLD messages.

    - Added support to enable/disable unicast forwarding in the kernel
      via the FEA.
      Currently, the support is only for FreeBSD, but is not used yet.
      Hence, the user must explicitly enable unicast forwarding
      before starting XORP.
      E.g., in case of FreeBSD run `sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding=1`
      as root. In case of Linux run
      `echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward` as root.

    - Fix a compilation problem for NetBSD
      (courtesy Hitoshi Asaeda <Hitoshi.Asaeda@sophia.inria.fr>
      and Jun-ichiro itojun Hagino <itojun@iijlab.net>).

    - Initial support for Linux /proc parsing to return network interface
      information (work in progress).

    - Bug fixes in setting the broadcast or p2p flags and addresses
      in the FEA internal interface tree (IfTree).

    - Bug fix in computing the minimum size of a message received
      on a routing socket.

    - Change the MFEA configuration scripts so now the IPv4/IPv6 setup
      is controlled by a single variable IP_VERSION that should be
      either IPV4 or IPV6. Note that those configuration scripts
      are temporary solution until the MFEA is integrated with
      the rtrmgr.

  RIB:
    - No significant changes.

  BGP:
    - Update packets with unknown path attributes are now correctly handled.

  MLD/IGMP:
    - Change the "RX" log messages to include the vif name a message was
      received on.

    - Initial support for returning the process status via get_status XRL.

    - Change the MLD/IGMP configuration scripts so now the IPv4/IPv6 setup
      is controlled by a single variable IP_VERSION that should be
      either IPV4 or IPV6. Note that those configuration scripts
      are temporary solution until the MLD/IGMP is integrated with
      the rtrmgr.

  PIM-SM:
    - Change the "RX" log messages to include the vif name a message was
      received on.

    - Change the PIM configuration scripts so now the IPv4/IPv6 setup
      is controlled by a single variable IP_VERSION that should be
      either IPV4 or IPV6. Note that those configuration scripts
      are temporary solution until the PIM is integrated with
      the rtrmgr.

    - Implement Join/Prune items fragmentation across Join/Prune messages
      when generating Join/Prune messages.

    - Fix some of the XRL names related to static RP configuration
      in the configuration shell scripts.

    - Fix the generation of Assert messages when data packets are received
      on the wrong interface; in addition, the Assert messages triggered
      by data packets are rate-limited to one Assert message/s (on
      average, per (S,G) or (*,G) routing entry).

    - Implement an optimization when generating Assert messages
      triggered by the data packets received on the wrong interface:
      suppress the second Assert message that is a duplicate.

    - Implement bandwidth-prorated SPT switch triggering:
      The SPT switch can be triggered at the last-hop router if the
      bandwidth from a given source is above a configured threshold.
      In addition, the same mechanism is implemented in the RP as well
      (not in the spec, where the SPT switch in the RP is always triggered
      by the first packet).

    - Keep various PIM-related statistics (e.g., number of sent
      or received PIM control messages per interface, etc), and add
      the appropriate XRL interface to get or reset those statistics.

    - Modify slightly the "show pim join" CLI output. E.g., print
      "Could assert WC:" for all entries, print "Could assert SG:"
      for (S,G,rpt) as well, etc.

    - Bug fix: when receiving IPv6 PIM packets, use the IPv6-specific
      pseudo-header to compute the checksum.

  CLI:
    - On exit, restore the original terminal flags in case of stdio-based
      CLI access. This should fix a bug when running xorpsh from sh/bash
      and pressing Ctrl-D leaves sh/bash in non-echo mode.

    - Reverse the key binding of 'j' and 'k' in page mode. Now the
      binding is same as in "vi/more/less":
      'j' scroll down one line, while 'k' scroll up one line.

  SNMP:
    - Full implementation of BGP4-MIB module (RFC 1657) including traps.

  RIP/RIPng:
    - Implementation functionally operational save communication with the RIB
      for injecting routes, the FEA to send and receive packets, FEA
      interface monitoring code, and an XRL interface for configuration.

Release 0.3 (2003/06/09)
========================
  ALL:
    - Compilation fixes for GCC3.3 on FreeBSD 4.8R.

    - Cross directory build and gmake check support.

    - Purge of abort() calls.  Replacement by XLOG_UNFINISHED,
      XLOG_UNREACHABLE and XLOG_ASSERT as appropriate, or in some
      cases better error handling code.

    - Change to autoconf-2.53 and automake-1.5 as standard autotool versions.
      The older autoconf-2.13 and automake-1.4 should still work.

    - Remove the multicast-specific timer implementation, and
      use instead the default Xorp timers (XorpTimer).

  LIBXORP:
    - Allocation without construction bug fixed in SelectorList code.  Fixes
      potential for junk values and sanity checking when the number of active
      file descriptors is large.

    - Addition of status codes for XORP processes to report operational
      state (to the rtrmgr).

    - Addition of XLOG_UNFINISHED and XLOG_UNREACHABLE to xlog.h.

    - Explicitly disable copy constructor and assignment operator for
      EventLoop.

    - Replacement of traditional struct timeval with TimeVal class.  TimeVal
      comes with constructors and numerous helper methods.

    - IPvXNet methods renaming:
      get_ipv4Net() -> get_ipv4net()
      get_ipv6Net() -> get_ipv6net()

  LIBXIPC:
    - Removal of 0.1 release Finder code and compatibility shims that allowed
      newer and older code to co-exist.  Renaming of "FinderNG" classes
      and files to "Finder".

    - Use of class and instance names and Finder policy for having a
      primary instance in a class (first registered is primary, then second
      in case first exits/fails, and so forth).

    - Support for tunneling XRLs and XRL responses to and from the Finder.

    - Implementation event notification through the Finder using tunneled
      XRLs.  XRL Targets can now request to be notified of the birth and
      death of other XRL Targets by the Finder.

    - Reduced number of XrlErrors to hopefully simplify handling errors.

    - Addition of new enumated type XrlErrorCode and change
      XrlError::error_code method to return this type.  Allows compiler to
      detect unhandled error types in switch statements (if default case is
      not used).

    - Finder clients no longer reconnect to the Finder should they lose their
      connection per ${XORP}/docs/design_arch/error_handling.tex.

    - Increased Finder timeout for call_xrl.

    - Fix memory corruption following Finder transport error events.

    - Convert all code to use FinderServer class when they need to instantiate
      a Finder.

    - More consistent handling of defaults on send and receive sides of Finder.

    - Fix xrl_parser_input.cc handling of absolute file names.

    - Assorted minor clean-ups.

  XRL:
    - Addition of get_status and shutdown methods to the common interface.

  RTRMGR:
    - Workaround for yacc incompatibilities on newer Redhat releases.

    - Implement a new TaskManager, which handles actually doing the
      work during a commit, starting processes and validating that they
      start, dependency interlocking between processes, and shutting
      down processes that are no longer needed.

    - rtrmgr will now shutdown processes after they are not needed.

    - rtrmgr can now use the common XRL call get_status to monitor
      process state, and the common XRL shutdown to gracefully shutdown a
      process.  Added new modinfo subcommands to specify when to use
      XRLs for these tasks.

    - Use system MD5 for authentication.

    - Better config file string parser.

    - Add tinderbox tests to cover some of the basic functionality.

    - Better error handling (more compliant with XORP Error Handling
      document).

  XORPSH:
    - Ctrl-C now terminates the current command,  Ctrl-D exits xorpsh.

  FEA:
    - MFEA code merged with the unicast FEA, though logically the MFEA
      is still a separate entity.

    - Refactoring of FEA internals regarding reading/writing/observing
      interfaces-related information and forwarding-table related
      information.

    - Support for few more OS-specific methods for reading
      interface-related information or forwarding table related information.

    - Addition of IPv6 support (where missing) for reading/writing information
      regarding network interfaces or the unicast forwarding table.

    - Addition of a command-line option to ``fea'' and ``fea_dummy'' to
      specify the finder hostname and port number.

    - On startup and shutdown remove from the kernel all forwarding entries
      added by the fea.

    - Addition of XRLs to obtain information about all network interfaces
      (i.e., not only those that are configured by the rtrmgr).
      Should be used only for debugging purpose (though temporary they
      are used by the MFEA as well).

    - ``fea_rtsock'' deprecated (replaced with the generic ``fea'').

  RIB:
    - Export a RIB table to any target that registers interest.

    - Replace fea_fti/0.1 XRL interface with fti/0.2.  The new interface
      introduces metric, admin_distance and protocol_origin when RIB
      information is propagated to the RIB clients.

    - Refactoring of the Vif manager implementation.

    - Support for returning the process status through the get_status
      XRL and shutting down using the shutdown XRL.

  BGP:
    - More robust to XRL communication failures. In particular support
      for retransmission.

    - Replace calls to abort() with more self-explanatory self-destruction.

    - Terminate interface removed and replaced with common shutdown XRL
      interface.

    - Use system md5 header files.

    - Peer list sorted by remote IP for snmp.

    - Uninitialised variable bug fix in NextHopRibRequest.

    - Initial support for returning the process status via get_status XRL.

  MFEA:
    - MFEA code merged with the unicast FEA, though logically the MFEA
      is still a separate entity.
      As part of the merging process, the MFEA now obtains the information
      about network interfaces and the unicast forwarding table from the
      FEA instead of the the kernel.

    - Addition of a check for Router Alert IP option.

    - Enable receiving of hop-by-hop options.

    - Replace all MLD6_XXX with MLD_XXX (following KAME's recommendation).

    - Compilation fixes for NetBSD-current (and probably NetBSD-1.6.1)
      (courtesy Hitoshi Asaeda <Hitoshi.Asaeda@sophia.inria.fr>).

    - Initial support for returning the process status via get_status XRL.

    - Addition of a command-line option to ``test_mfea'' to specify the
      finder hostname and port number.

    - Misc. bug fixes, internal code refactoring, and cleanup.

  MLD/IGMP:
    - Protocol implementation testing completed.

    - Replace all MLD6_XXX with MLD_XXX (following KAME's recommendation).

    - Unify some of the MLD and IGMP protocol-specific code.

    - Support for configurable setting of the protocol version per vif.

    - Addition of a command-line option to ``test_mld6igmp'' to specify the
      finder hostname and port number.

    - Misc. bug fixes.

  PIM-SM:
    - Configuration-related fixes.

    - Rename RP-related configuration commands and XRLs:
      OLD: add_config_rp{4,6}, delete_config_rp{4,6}, config_rp_done
      NEW: add_config_static_rp{4,6}, delete_config_static_rp{4,6},
           config_static_rp_done

    - Addition of XRL interface to receive MRIB-related updates
      from the RIB; the interface is not used yet.

    - Initial support for returning the process status via get_status XRL.

    - Addition of a mechanism that should hold-off PIM-SM status
      to PROC_NOT_READY until it has received all necessary confirmation
      from both MFEA and MLD/IGMP.

    - Addition of PIM configuration option and XRL interface to configure
      the SPT-switch bandwidth threshold.  Currently, the SPT-switch is
      enabled only for the corner cases: switch on the first packet, or
      never switch.

    - Addition of a command-line option to ``test_pim'' to specify the
      finder hostname and port number.

  CLI:
    - Critical bug fix (could be triggered if a program like
      ${XORP}/pim/test_pim is run in background, and is accessed
      by the built-in CLI).

    - Addition of Ctrl-C handling:
      o If Ctrl-C is hit before <Enter>, then cancel the current line
        and present a new prompt.
      o If Ctrl-C is hit while waiting for command completion, then
        cancel the wait and present a new prompt.

    - Removed the 5 seconds timer that would timeout the waiting for
      command completion (the user can use Ctrl-C to cancel the wait).

    - Enable receiving Ctrl-C if the input is stdio (e.g., in case of xorpsh).

  SNMP:
    - Integrated with Net-SNMP agent.

    - Implemented bgpVersion and bgpPeerTable from BGP4-MIB (RFC 1657).

  RIP/RIPng:
    - Implementation started.

Release 0.2 (2003/03/10)
========================

  ALL:
    - Source code compiles under GCC 3.2.1 and on Mac OS X 10.2.x (GCC 3.1)
      in addition to GCC 2.95.x and 2.96.

  LIBXORP:
    - Add libxorp/ref_trie.hh :
      Implementation of a trie to support route
      lookups.  Based on trie.hh, but with reference-counted storage
      supporting delayed deletion.

  LIBXIPC:
    - Complete re-implementation of the XRL finder, so that
      registration/deregistration to the finder uses XRLs.

  RTRMGR:
    - Add operational-mode commands for monitoring BGP routes and
      peers, and VIF/interface state.

    - Re-implement how rtrmgr decides when to start processes.  This
      fixes a few bugs in the dependency tracking - prior to this the
      RIB would not be started because it requires no direct configuration.

  FEA:
    - Bug fixes.

  RIB:
    - Ensure that the originating protocol is propagated throughout
      the RIB.

    - Fix bug where routes for directly connected interfaces were
      incorrectly being fed back to the FEA (which didn't expect to
      see add_route for these subnets).

  BGP:
    - XRL interfaces for monitoring BGP peers and the complete BGP
      routing table added.  Helper programs bgp/tools/show_routes and
      bgp/tools/show_peers added, along with versions of these for
      running from xorpsh.

    - Support for adding/removing MEDs added.

    - BGP message handling and Path Attribute handling re-written to
      be much cleaner and more efficient.

    - Re-structured the BGP peer state machine to make the code easier
      to understand.

    - Change BGP to use reference-counted tries.  This greatly
      simplifies the implementation of background tasks.

    - Correctly handle unrecognized optional transitive attributes.

    - Merge isolation tests into a single binary.

    - Added BGP/RIB/FEA integration tests.

    - Too many bug fixes to list.

  MFEA:
    - Minor bug fixes.

  MLD/IGMP:
    - No changes.

  PIM-SM:
    - PIM-SM Bootstrap mechanism reimplemented and tested.
      Note that the Bootstrap-related configuration commands in
      pim/configure_pim have changed slightly.

    - Detailed testing of the basic protocol and the Bootstrap mechanism
      completed and documented in the XORP PIM-SM Test Suite document.

    - Numerous bug fixes.


Release 0.1 (2002/12/11)
========================

  - First public release.

  - CVS repository opened to the world.
