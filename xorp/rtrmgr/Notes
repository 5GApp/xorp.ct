Notes
-----

Saving files.  We want a XORP user to be able to save the config to a
file, and another XORP user to be able to load that config.  The
question is what we do regarding file ownership and permissions, and
whether the xorpsh or rtrmgr process actually does the save.

The simplest solution appears to be for the rtrmgr to do the save.
This prevents file ownership problems.  The risk is that as the rtrmgr
runs as root, it might be possible to maliciously overwrite files on
the router system.

There are a number of steps we can take to prevent this.  The simplest
is to allow the user to specify only the root of the filename, but not
the extension.  This prevents the user having enough control to
overwrite most files on the system.  In addition, we might check that
the file being overwritten is a xorp config file, either through
tagging the start of xorp config files, or by attempting to parse
them.  The former is probably better, as it allows the config
templates to evolve.  We can also check the file permissions - perhaps
making xorp config files xorp/wheel with permissions 664, and refusing
to overwrite a file that isn't owned by root and wheel writable.
