Multicast Listener Discovery/Internet Group Management Protocol
(MLD/IGMP) Implementation
===============================================================

This directory contains the XORP implementation of the MLD and IGMP protocols.

Configuration
=============

MLD/IGMP like most XORP processes does not take its configuration
parameters from the command line. Its parameters are provided via
XRLs. At the very least a MLD/IGMP process must be provided with
the set of network interfaces to enable for multicast.

Startup
=======

In normal operation, MLD/IGMP would be started by the XORP router manager
process, not directly from the command line.  
For information how to configure MLD/IGMP see
http://www.xorp.org/getting_started.html
or
http://www.xorp.org/releases/current/docs/user_manual/user_manual.pdf

Documentation
=============

The MLD/IGMP design architecture and code structure are described in:
	${XORP}/docs/mld6igmp/

The programming documentation is in:
	${XORP}/docs/kdoc/html/mld6igmp/

Testing
=======

Currently, the MLD/IGMP testing is performed manually, by starting
MLD/IGMP on a number of testbed machines.

In the future, automated testing will be added, similar to
the BGP testing framework.

Status
======

The MLD/IGMP implementation is based on the specification in the
following documents:

 * RFC 2236: Internet Group Management Protocol, Version 2
 * RFC 3376: Internet Group Management Protocol, Version 3
 * RFC 2710: Multicast Listener Discovery for IPv6, Version 1
 * RFC 3810: Multicast Listener Discovery Version 2 (MLDv2) for IPv6
