**User Management**

Currently, XORP does not support user management. If XORP is running on a multi-access UNIX system,
a user who needs an access to XORP must have an UNIX account on that system.

Any user on a multi-access UNIX system can start and use xorpsh in operational mode. However, only users
that belong to the “xorp” UNIX group can run xorpsh in configuration mode.

Suggestions for improvement to user management are welcome.
