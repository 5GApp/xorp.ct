====== XORP Documentation Project ======
It's a **work in progress** - please let us know what additional help you would find useful.
===== Overview =====
XORP is an open networking platform that supports OSPF, RIP, BGP,
OLSR, VRRP, PIM, IGMP (Multicast) and other routing protocols.  Most protocols
support IPv4 and IPv6 where applicable.  It is known to work on various
Linux distributions and flavors of BSD.  Support for [[http://www.proposable.com|proposal software]] cross-compiling XORP to Microsoft [[http://www.bestpills4weightloss.com/purebiotix-review.html|purebiotix weight loss pill review]] Windows using the mingw cross-compiler was recently (March 2011) added.

XORP started life as a project at the ICSI Center for Open Networking (ICON)
at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, California,
USA, and spent some time with [[http://thebeginnerslens.com/|iphone photography]] the [[http://www.diamondlinks.net/|link building]] team at XORP, Inc.  The project maintainer
is now [[mailto:greearb@candelatech.com | Ben Greear]] from [[http://www.candelatech.com/ | Candela Technologies]] and
the old XORP.CT code base is now the official development tree.

XORP's primary goal is to be an open platform for networking protocol
implementations and an alternative to proprietary and [[http://www.andrewflusche.com/services/spotsylvania-reckless-driving-defense/|Spotsylvania reckless driving]] closed networking
products.

===== To be merged with the new documentation project =====
<note warning>It is possible that some ECODE specifics are present in the 
[[http://www.merchantos.com/|point of sale software]] documents. Nothing important and not much, though. </note>

==== Hosting ====

This website is hosted and put at your free disposal thanks to the [[http://www.run.montefiore.ulg.ac.be | Research Unit in Networking (RUN)]] @ [[http://www.ulg.ac.be | University of Li√®ge]].
It is part of the [[http://www.montefiore.ulg.ac.be | Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department (Montefiore Institute)]] and of the [[http://www.ulg.ac.be/facsa | Faculty of Applied Sciences]]. 

The unit is headed by Prof. Guy Leduc. Current research in RUN bears on computer networks and more specifically on traffic engineering, MPLS, mobile communication, congestion control, multicast and active/programmable networks. Former research in RUN also focused on models and languages suitable for formal specification, verification, implementation and testing of communicating systems, and especially of real time systems.
