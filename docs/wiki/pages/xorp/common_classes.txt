===== ServiceBase ==
<note>
This class provides a base for services within Xorp processes.  A service instance is an entity that can logically started and stopped and typically needs some asynchronous processing in order to start and stop.
</note>

Such a service can typically be in following states: //TO DO: make a state diagram from these status//
  * ''SERVICE_READY''
  * ''SERVICE_STARTING''
  * ''SERVICE_RUNNING''
  * ''SERVICE_PAUSING''
  * ''SERVICE_PAUSED''
  * ''SERVICE_RESUMING''
  * ''SERVICE_SHUTTING_DOWN''
  * ''SERVICE_SHUTDOWN''
  * ''SERVICE_FAILED''

The status can be retrieved by using the appropriate method from the ''ServiceBase'' class.\\
Another way is by using and registering a ''ServiceChangeObserverBase'' instance nearby the ''ServiceBase'' instance. In case of status change, the ''status_change'' method of this observer will be executed.
