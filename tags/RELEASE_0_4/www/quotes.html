A search on Google turned up this quote:

<DD><I> Peperdos' moustache drooped. "I fear, my son, even should you
come to possess all this virtue, you cannot help the world. For the
highest virtue of all has vanished entirely, and people nowadays
scarcely know what it is anymore."
<P>The saucer-boy was afraid to ask what this cardinal virtue was, for
fear of being lumped in with "people nowadays."
<P>
"Xorp," Peperdos answered, without waiting for a question. "Xorp has
vanished from the world. Our statesmen and generals in the Army hardly
know what Xorp is anymore. The young generation have forsaken Xorp
entirely. We are in a Xorpless age, my son, and without Xorp, mighty
deeds will not be done."</I>
