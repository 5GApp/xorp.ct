Any of these items are up for grabs.  Before embarking on them send a
note to the developers list to check they are not covered by work in
progress.

o Add virtual event methods to XrlRouter for Finder related events.
  At present this information is not available without polling (a
  not-so-great design choice).

	XrlRouter::finder_connection_event()
	XrlRouter::finder_disconnection_event()
	XrlRouter::registration_complete_event()

o Add support for pipelining in Xrl protocol families.

o Add support for handling one-to-many resolutions at client end, ie
  implement a standard policy mechanism or have hooks for generic
  policies.


o Rework the xrl parser related routines to make them more akin to the
  parsing capabilities of the python scripts used to generate XRL
  interfaces.

o Copy minimization in existing protocol families.  There are a few
  unnecessary copies that should be eliminated.  This may be
  straightforward.  We might also want to consider using reference
  counted XrlAtoms.

o Implement additional protocol families (signals, UNIX domain
  sockets, XXX Your IPC mechanism here XXX)

o Find whatever bug is stopping the TCP protocol family from passing
  BGP tests.
