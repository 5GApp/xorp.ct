Contained herein you'll find some reading materials that have proved
useful or insightful to the Xorp developers with regard to getting to
grips with C++.

 * The C++ Programming Language (3rd Edition), Bjarne Stroustrup,
   Addison-Wesley.

     The definitive C++ book.  Like the language, it's rather large,
     and as reading matter it's not terribly entertaining.  It's a
     useful reference book, though tough to read cover to cover.

 * The ANSI/ISO C++ Professional Programmer's Handbook, Danny Kalev,
   Que (ISBN 0789720221).

     An excellent alternative to Stroustrup.  Clearly and concisely
     written.  Only 350 some pages.  Punchy and to the point.  Assumes
     rudimentary knowledge of C++ at the start and builds around the
     ANSI C++ standard.

 * Effective C++: 50 Specific Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs,
   Scott Meyers, Addison-Wesley (ISBN 0201924889).

   More Effective C++: 35 New Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs,
   Scott Meyers, Addison-Wesley (ISBN 020163371X).

     Exceptionally readable and valuable.  If you've not programmed
     in C++ before, or have not programmed in C++ recently, then
     these are both well worth reading.

 * SGI STL documentation (http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/).

     Hypertext documentation covering the C++ Standard Template
     Library.  Essential at hand reference.  Includes design
     documents and has many examples of the STL in action.

 * The C++ Standard Library: A Tutorial and Reference, Nicolai M. Josuttis,
   Addison-Wesley (ISBN 0201379260).

     More extensive STL documentation.  Handy reference (i++ or ++i :-).

 * Design Patterns, Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John
   Vlissides, Addison-Wesley (ISBN 0201633612).

     Presents a catalog of design patterns.  A little dry to read, but
     a good intro and reference.

 * Modern C++ Design: Generic Programming and Design Patterns Applied,
   Andrei Alexandrescu, Addison-Wesley (ISBN 0201704315).

     This is a hard C++ book.  It presents a bedazzling array of
     template specialization magic.  There's not too much in the
     project that stems directly from this book, but it's mind blowing
     material.
