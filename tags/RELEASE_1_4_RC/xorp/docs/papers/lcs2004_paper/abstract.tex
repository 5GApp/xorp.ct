\noindent\textbf{Abstract:} Network researchers face a significant problem when deploying software in routers.  Router platforms are generally not open systems.  In this paper we discuss the problems this poses, and present an eXtensible Open Router Platform (XORP) which has the key goals are extensibility, performance and robustness. XORP is both a research tool and a stable deployment platform, thus easing the transition of ideas from the
lab to the real world.
