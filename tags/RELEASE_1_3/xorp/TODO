* Add a list with acknowledgments for all people who have contributed:
  bug reports/fixes/etc. This list will go with the source code,
  and a similar list should be on the Web page.

* Modify all documents to contain a list of contributors.

* Standardize the version string format return by the
  common_0_1_get_version XRL across all targets.

* Add "-ansi" and "-pedantic" flags to the gcc/g++ compilation flags

* Change configure.in NOT to use AC_EGREP_HEADER to check
  for various fields, etc in system header files. Instead,
  it should use AC_TRY_COMPILE or AC_TRY_RUN.

* Remove all #include "config.h" (except for "libxorp/xorp.h"),
  and fix the devnotes/coding-style.txt that "libxorp/xorp.h"
  should be included by all files (rather than "config.h").

* Fix all file names.
  E.g. all names non-capital letters + numbers, and use underscores.

* Consolidate the way we render bools as strings, i.e. make the use
  of bool2str() vs truefalse() vs explicit tertiary operator consistent
  and settle on one only if possible.

* Libtoolize flower_malloc.

* Don't use sprintf(3) and friends. Instead, use the safer snprintf(3)
  and friends.
