// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Pre 1.0 Release

* Validate origin address in Port<A>::port_io_receive If packet does
  not come from a host on the same network or from the end of a point
  to point link it should not be processed.

* Add HopCount check on received RIPng packets.

* Check and double check nexthop handling paying attention to incoming
  and outgoing interfaces and their properties.

* Handle interfaces coming up and down and socket errors.

* Inter-op testing.

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Post 1.0 Release

* MIB.

* Clean up RIB interaction.  Add flag to each router indicating that
  the RIB is aware it and nobble flag when route is updated.

* Consider keeping losing routes, age them in the normal way, etc, and
  be prepared to fall back to them if/when winning routes expire.

* Arrange to have triggered updates go out of all RIP Port instances
  at the same time.  This is a little tricky as each RIP Port instance
  is autonomous.

* Add horizon checks to tools/rip_announcer.cc and
  tools/ripng_announcer.cc for packets they receive.  This is icing on
  the cake.
