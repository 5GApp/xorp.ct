Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Implementation
==============================================

This directory contains the XORP implementation of the OSPF protocol.

Configuration
=============

Startup
=======

Documentation
=============

The programming documentation is in:
	${XORP}/docs/kdoc/html/ospf/

Testing
=======

As with most XORP processes, running "gmake check" in the ospf
directory will run a set of validation checks.  Any new functionality
committed to ospf must come with it's own set of validation checks.

Status
======

March 2006: OSPFv2 is complete, the NSSA implementation does not
support translator election.

The OSPFv3 implementation still requires the IPv6 specific routing
computations to be completed.
