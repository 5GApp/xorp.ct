	Build Notes for XORP (eXtensible Open Router Platform)



1. Compilation
==============

To compile XORP, you must have GNU make (gmake) installed. Then just
run the following commands in the top-level directory:

./configure
gmake

To change the default C and C++ compilers, then assign the binary
names to the CC and CXX user environmental variables respectively.
E.g., if you want to use the gcc34/g++34 compilers, then use (in case
of csh/tcsh) the following commands before running "./configure":

setenv CC gcc34
setenv CXX g++34

To compile XORP with additional user-specified compiler flags, assign
those flags to the CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS environmental variables (for the
C and C++ compiler respectively) before running "./configure".
If the flags must be after all other compiler flags (e.g., if they
are suppose to overwrite some internally added flags), then use
environmental variables CFLAGS_END and CXXFLAGS_END (for the C and C++
compiler respectively).

2. Internal tests
=================

To run the internal tests, you must have "bash" and "python" installed.
Note that if the python's executable filename is not "python", then
you would have to create a symbolic link with such name. E.g., execute
as a root:

cd /path/to/python/binary
ln -s python2.4 python

After the code is compiled, you need to run the following command
in the top-level XORP directory:

gmake check


3. OS-specific notes
======================

3.1. FreeBSD
============

  * FreeBSD-4.5, FreeBSD-4.6.2, FreeBSD-4.6-RELEASE, FreeBSD-4.8-RELEASE:
    - Earlier XORP releases have been developed and tested on those
      platforms.

  * FreeBSD-4.9-RELEASE and FreeBSD-4.10-RELEASE:
    - No known issues.
    - The code should compile with the following versions of the
      gcc/g++ compiler: 2.95.4 (default), 3.3.4, and
      3.4.2 20040827 (prerelease)

  * FreeBSD-5.1:
    - The default gcc/g++ compiler (version 3.2.2) has a bug, hence
      you must install a new compiler (e.g., gcc-3.3 from
      /usr/ports/lang/gcc33 in the ports collection). Then, you must
      set environmental variables CC and CXX to point to the new compiler
      before running "./configure"
      (e.g., "setenv CC gcc33; setenv CXX g++33").
    - The code compiles with the new compiler, and the internal tests
      appear to succeed.

  * FreeBSD-5.2, FreeBSD-5.3, FreeBSD-5.4
    - The code compiles with the default compiler, and the internal tests
      appear to succeed.

  * FreeBSD-6.0 on i386
    - No known issues.

  * FreeBSD-6.0 on amd64
    - The utils/flower_malloc/test_flower_malloc.sh test fails.
    - Multicast routing doesn't work because of a broken "struct igmpmsg"
      definition inside <netinet/ip_mroute.h>.
      The fix (already in the FreeBSD CVS repository) is to replace
      u_long with uint32_t inside the body of "struct igmpmsg", and
      then recompile both the FreeBSD kernel and XORP.
    - The SNMP support inside the "mibs" directory fails to compile.
    - The rest of code compiles with the default compiler, and the internal
      tests appear to succeed:
      gcc (GCC) 3.4.4 [FreeBSD] 20050518

  * The following compiler is known to be buggy, and should not be used
    to compile XORP:
    - gcc34 (GCC) 3.4.0 20040310 (prerelease) [FreeBSD]
    A newer compiler such as the following should be used instead:
    - gcc34 (GCC) 3.4.2 20040827 (prerelease) [FreeBSD]

  * FreeBSD-6.1 (BETA3)
    - The code compiles with the default compiler, and the internal tests
      appear to succeed:
      gcc (GCC) 3.4.4 [FreeBSD] 20050518

3.2. NetBSD
===========

  * NetBSD-2.0 and NetBSD-3.0:
    - The SNMP support inside the "mibs" directory may fail to compile.
    - The rest of code compiles, and the internal tests appear to succeed:
      gcc (GCC) 3.3.3 (NetBSD nb3 20040520)
    - If the compilation fails with the following error:
      "/usr/pkg/bin/bash: Undefined PLT symbol "read" (reloc type = 7, symnum = 92)"
      then just run "gmake" again, and the compilation should continue from
      the point it has failed.
    - The default datasize limit per user may not be sufficient to compile
      some parts of the code, hence you may need to increase the datasize
      limit.  If you see a compilation error like:
	  ld: final link failed: Memory exhausted
      then you should increase the data size limit by
      "limit datasize 200000" in csh/tcsh or "ulimit -d 200000" in sh.
      If necessary, increase further the datasize limit.
    - The default limit of maximum opened file descriptors per process
      is 64 which may not be sufficient. If you run a XORP program and
      there are errors like:

	  [ 2004/06/20 22:26:09  ERROR test_pim:31634 LIBCOMM +582 comm_sock.c comm_sock_accept ] Error accepting socket 4: Too many open files

      then you should increase the file descriptors limit by
      "limit descriptors 400" in csh/tcsh or "ulimit -n 400" in sh.

3.3. OpenBSD
============

  * If the system would be used as a multicast router, then add the
    following lines to /etc/rc.conf.local and reboot:

    # Enable multicast routing (see netstart(8) for details).
    multicast_host=NO
    multicast_router=YES

    Note that OpenBSD-3.7 is the first release that has PIM multicast routing
    support in the kernel.

  * OpenBSD-3.5:
    - The default gcc/g++ compiler (version 2.95.x) has a bug, hence
      you must install a new compiler (e.g., gcc-3.3.2 and g++-3.3.2 from
      packages). Then, you must set environmental variables CC and CXX
      to point to the new compiler before running "./configure"
      (e.g., "setenv CC egcc; setenv CXX eg++").
    - The code compiles with the new compiler, but some of the internal
      tests fail.
    - The default datasize limit per user may not be sufficient to compile
      some parts of the code, hence you may need to increase the datasize
      limit.  If you see a compilation error like:
	  /usr/bin/ld: final link failed: Memory exhausted
	  collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
      then you should increase the data size limit by
      "limit datasize 200000" in csh/tcsh or "ulimit -d 200000" in sh.
      If necessary, increase further the datasize limit.
    - The default limit of maximum opened file descriptors per process
      is 64 which may not be sufficient. If you run a XORP program and
      there are errors like:

	  [ 2004/06/20 22:26:09  ERROR test_pim:31634 LIBCOMM +582 comm_sock.c comm_sock_accept ] Error accepting socket 4: Too many open files

      then you should increase the file descriptors limit by
      "limit descriptors 400" in csh/tcsh or "ulimit -n 400" in sh.

  * OpenBSD-3.6-current (as of February 2005) on i386 and amd64,
    and OpenBSD-3.8:
    - The default gcc/g++ compiler (version 3.3.5 (propolice)) has a bug
      in the propolice implementation:
          http://www.monkey.org/openbsd/archive2/tech/200503/msg00011.html
      Hence, you must disable the propolice feature. You need to add the
      "-fno-stack-protector" flag to your CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS
      environmental variables. E.g. (in csh/tcsh): 
	  setenv CFLAGS -fno-stack-protector
	  setenv CXXFLAGS -fno-stack-protector
	  ./configure
    - The code compiles, and the internal tests appear to succeed.
      Multicast routing seems to work.
    - The default datasize limit per user may not be sufficient to compile
      some parts of the code, hence you may need to increase the datasize
      limit.  If you see a compilation error like:
	  collect2: ld terminated with signal 11 [Segmentation fault], core dumped
      then you should increase the data size limit by
      "limit datasize 200000" in csh/tcsh or "ulimit -d 200000" in sh.
      If necessary, increase further the datasize limit.
    - The default limit of maximum opened file descriptors per process
      is 64 which may not be sufficient. If you run a XORP program and
      there are errors like:

	  [ 2004/06/20 22:26:09  ERROR test_pim:31634 LIBCOMM +582 comm_sock.c comm_sock_accept ] Error accepting socket 4: Too many open files

      then you should increase the file descriptors limit by
      "limit descriptors 400" in csh/tcsh or "ulimit -n 400" in sh.

3.4. Linux
==========

  * Linux RedHat-7.2 (kernel 2.4.18):
    - The code compiles, but some of the internal tests fail dumping core.
      The problem is attributable to exception handler failures caused by
      the default compiler/binutils combination.  More information is
      available at:
	http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54724
    - IGMP and PIM-SM appear to work.

  * Linux RedHat-7.3 (kernel 2.4-20):
    - No known issues.
    - The code should compile with the following versions of the
      gcc/g++ compiler: 2.96 (default).

  * Linux RedHat-9.2 (kernel 2.4.20-8smp):
    - You must install the following RPMs (and all other RPMs they depend on):
      - openssl-devel (e.g., openssl-devel-0.9.7a-5.i386.rpm)
      - ncurses (e.g., ncurses-5.3-4.i386.rpm)
    - The code compiles, and the internal tests appear to succeed.

  * Linux Fedora Core2 (kernel 2.6.5-1.358):
    - The code compiles, but some of the internal tests may fail.

  * Linux Fedora Core4 (kernel 2.6.11-1.1369_FC4smp):
    - The code compiles, and the internal tests appear to succeed
      with the following compilers: gcc-4.0.0 (default), gcc-4.0.1,
      gcc-4.0.2

  * There is a known problem with building XORP on Linux with gcc-4.0.x
    and optimization enabled. It is a bug in gcc, see XORP Bugzilla #435
    for details:
        http://www.xorp.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=435
    A simple work-around is not to enable compiler's optimization.

  * There is a known problem with building XORP on Linux with gcc-3.3
    or gcc-3.4 and post-2.15 binutils.
    It is a bug in gcc, see XORP Bugzilla #497 for details:
        http://www.xorp.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=497
    Newer versions of the gcc compiler (e.g., gcc-4.0.2 or gcc-4.1) should
    be used instead.

3.5. Mac OS X
=============

  * All:
    - Unicast routing appears to work.
    - Multicast routing doesn't work, because the kernel doesn't have
      the appropriate support.

  * OS X 10.3.8 (Darwin 7.8.0):
    - gcc version 3.3 20030304 (Apple Computer, Inc. build 1495)
    - The code compiles, and the internal tests appear to succeed.

  * OS X 10.4.2 (Darwin 8.2.0), OS X 10.4.3 (Darwin 8.3.0),
    OS X 10.4.4 (Darwin 8.4.0), OS X 10.4.5 (Darwin 8.5.0).
    - gcc version 4.0.0 20041026 (Apple Computer, Inc. build 4061)
    - The code compiles, and the internal tests appear to succeed.

3.6 Windows Server 2003 (Service Pack 1)
========================================

  * All:
    - Unicast routing appears to work.
    - Multicast routing doesn't work, because the system doesn't have
      the appropriate support.
    - IPv6 is not supported at this time. We are looking at supporting
      this on Longhorn.
    - All regression tests pass as of the XORP 1.2 Release Candidate.

    - We do not support the use of XORP on any Windows platform other than
      Windows Server 2003 SP1 at this time.

    - The code compiles using the MinGW port of gcc 3.4.2, using the
      MSYS shell environment.

    - Instructions for building XORP on Windows Server are now almost
      identical to those for building XORP on a UNIX platform.

      However, certain manual patches must be applied to the toolchain before
      attempting to build XORP, as we use API functions which are present in
      Microsoft's Platform SDK but which are not yet present in the system
      headers which ship with MinGW as of January 2006.

      These may be found in the xorp/contrib/win32 directory.

      * Download the source for w32api-3.5 from mingw.org and untar it
        into a writable location.
      * Change into this directory.
      * Apply the w32api-3.5-xorp.patch to this tree with 'patch -p1'.
      * From within the w32api-3.5 directory, run ./configure --prefix=/
        to ensure that the existing w32api binary installation will be
        overwritten.
      * make && make install

      Lastly, apply the mingw.patch within /usr/include. If this patch
      does not apply cleanly, you may need to edit unistd.h manually. We
      find that this file changes between MinGW releases and often needs
      manual attention. If this is the case please make a note of the
      MinGW toolchain components you are using and contact the XORP
      development team with this information.

    - We recommend that you install MinGW, MSYS, and the required GNU/Win32
      ports under the path C:\MinGW\.

    - We recommend that you initially use the Nullsoft Installer which
      is now shipping on MinGW.org to install the 'current' version of
      the base MinGW tools.

    - Once the base MinGW installation is complete, you should then
      manually update the toolchain which this program installs by
      downloading and untarring the following packages:-

       * MSYS-1.0.11-2004
       * binutils-2.15.91
       * gcc-g++
       * gcc-core
       * gdb-6.3-1
       * mingw-runtime
       * mingw-utils
       * mingw32-make
       * msysDTK-1.0.0
       * w32api-3.5

    - Make sure that aliases exist for mingw32-make.exe as make.exe and
      gmake.exe. We find it easier just to make copies.

    - You must install the following GNU/Win32 ports:-

       * openssl-bin (Binaries)
       * openssl-lib (Developer files)
       * pcre-bin (Binaries)
       * pcre-lib (Developer files)

      They may be found at: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages.html

    - The RunCommand class has a hard-coded path to the MSYS shell of
      C:\MINGW\BIN\SH.EXE. This will eventually go away but for now
      we recommend you use SUBST and/or NT junction points to symlink
      this to the correct path for your installation.

    - To take a full BGP route feed, a registry key must be updated:
      HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters
      must be set to 0xFFFFFFFF. Be warned that this removes the upper
      limit on use of nonpageable system memory for kernel FIB entries;
      if the kernel FIB memory requirements ever exceed physical memory,
      the NT kernel will panic.

    - If the Windows Routing and Remote Access (RRAS) service is running,
      the XORP FEA process may not be able to update the Windows IPv4
      routing tables. The FEA will detect when this service is running
      and print a warning message to the XORP process log.

    - The XORP Shell (xorpsh.exe) should be run from within a native
      Win32 command prompt.

  * For instructions how to build the XORP Installer for Windows
    see xorp/contrib/win32/installer/README.
