Those are the instructions for building the XORP Installer for Windows:
  - Make sure you have a full MSYS/MinGW environment set up as
    described in ${XORP}/BUILD_NOTES.
  - Make sure you have the Nullsoft Installer toolkit installed:
      http://nsis.sourceforge.net/
  - Make sure the path to makensis.exe is in your PATH.
  - Check out the xorp/contrib/win32/installer/xorp.nsi script.
  - Fiddle with the SRCDIR and DLLDIR settings if you have to, to
    point to where you have built the source and installed MinGW.
  - Run makensis xorp.nsi.
  - Test the installer.
