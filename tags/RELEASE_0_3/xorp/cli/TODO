* If SPACE is pressed on empty line at the bottom of the terminal xterm
  window, and then Ctrl-D is pressed, the command completion help output
  overlaps with the current line.

* For consistency with other modules, rename init_family argument to
  family in the CliNode constructor. Do similar renaming for other arguments.

* Implement CliCommand::create_default_cli_commands() and use
  it as appropriate.

* Don't return any error if a command with exactly same help, etc
  was installed already. (??)

* Add output paging for <TAB> generated help

* Change cli_command->server_name() and friends to 'processor_name'

* Handle syncronously the XRL response to a command

* When disconnecting a CliClient during initialization of a connection,
  due to an error, print the error.

* When asking for help '?' or <Tab> on a command that supports optional
  arguments, print those optional arguments as well.

* Add CliNode::delete_command()

* cli_command->name() for the root command is empty string.
  When printing error with cli_command->name(), use '' around the command
  name to make it clear where the command is.

* Implement the missing pipe filters

* Add support for \" escaping of a quotation.

* Parse the pipe commands and return error if the (number of) arguments
  do not match

* Change/fix pop_token() to return an error when no pair of quotations found

* Add support to handle longer lines when paging

* Check if the cli_client->_buffer_line magic indeed works if the
  very last cli_printf() doesn't have '\n' at the end.

* Commbine the "Enter" help message to be defined at a single place

* Help messages for following commands are not same as in Juniper:
  -  "| compare rollback"
  -  "| display detail"
  -  "| display inheritance"
  -  "| display xml"

* If no command is typed, the pressing "SPACE" should or should
  not list the available commands? Right now, pressing the SPACE
  when nothing typed at all will NOT list the available commands;
  also, pressing it after another command will not list the sub-commands.

* When ^D is pressed in the beginning of a line, the connection is closed.
  Is this a desired behavior?

* Implement name completion for filenames and for usernames (when appropriate).

* In Juniper, we have:
  "Delete all characters on the command line" : Ctrl-u or Ctrl-x
  "Delete the word before cursor" : Ctrl-w, Esc-Backspace, or Alt-Backspace

  In libtecla, all the above combinations works except "Ctrl-u" and "Ctrl-w".
  Do we want to add those two combinations as well?

  Other keys that don't work are:
  "Search the CLI history in reverse order..." : Ctrl-r
  "Search the CLI history by typing ..." : Esc-/
