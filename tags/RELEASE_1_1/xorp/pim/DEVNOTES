* Always call PimMre::entry_try_remove() for (S,G,rpt) routing entry
  whenever one of the following happens:
  - its Override Timer timeout or is canceled: PimMre::override_timer();
  - the upstream state machine moves to RPTNotJoined or NotPruned state:
    PimMre::set_rpt_not_joined_state()
    PimMre::set_not_pruned_state();
  - the downstream interface state machine moves to NoInfo state
    PimMre::set_downstream_noinfo_state()

* If accept_nohello_neighbors configuration is set to true,
  all messages enumerated below will be accepted from a neighbor that didn't
  send a Hello first: Join/Prune, Bootstrap, Assert, Graft, GraftAck.
  Further, the Hello holdtime value for such neighbors will be assumed
  to be MAX(Default_Hello_Holdtime, Default J/P Holdtime = 3.5*t_periodic)

* PimRpfTable::find(const IPvX& address)
  returns NULL if the RPF PimVif is not UP.

* PimMre::check_switch_to_spt_sg() does NOT restart the KeepAliveTimer(S,G)
  If necessary, this timer must be restarted by the function that calls
  PimMre::check_switch_to_spt_sg()
  
* The SPT-bit is set only for (S,G) PimMre entry.
  Fortunately, needs to be set only after an (S,G) Join or (S,G) Assert
  message is received. Hence, the side effect of this is that
  if there is (S,G) asssert, we must create (S,G) PimMre entry.
  If the (S,G) Assert was the only reason to create a (S,G) PimMre entry,
  we must delete that entry if the Assert state expires.
  
* If an output_state_t action for PimMre tracking state needs to
  be applied to more than one type of PimMre entry,
  then in PimMreTrackState::output_state_foo()
  call the corresponding track_state_foo() more
  than once: once for each PimMre entry type.

* The macros in Section "4.3.  Designated Routers (DR) and Hello Messages"
  are not added to the PimMre::track_dependency_*() methods.

* PimMre::set_rp_entry() is set only for (*,G) entries. The (S,G) and (S,G,rpt)
  entries get rp_entry() indirectly through their own (*,G) entry.

* PimMrt table contains four separate lookup tables:
  (S,G), (S,G,rpt), (*,G), and (*,*,RP) tables
  In addition, there is a separate MFC table.

* If (S,G) Assert is received, we keep it only in an (S,G) PimMre entry,
  even if this means that we may have to create it first (e.g.,
  when we are forwarding on (S,G,rpt) entry.

* If there is an (S,G) entry, we may not have (*,G) entry.

* A PimRp entry contains a list of all (*,G) entries that match to
  that RP, but two lists of only those (S,G) and (S,G,rpt) entries
  that don't have (*,G) entry.

* Whenever pim_mre_find() is used to create a new PimMre entry,
  make sure that pim_mre->recompute_is_join_desired_FOO();
  is called in case none of the downstream-related state is changed.
