	LIBXIPC: Xrl Inter-Process Communication Library

The libxipc library provides inter-process communication for XORP
processes.

Documentation
=============

Overview material is present in:
	$(XORP)/docs/libxipc 

and programming documentation in:
	$(XORP)/devnotes/html/libxipc

Testing
=======

The libxipc directory Makefile supports the check target that runs
through the tests.

Status
======

This code is functional and widely used.  There are two
implementations of this code.  In the initial version the Finder and
Finder protocol are independent of the basic Xrl types and marshalling
mechanisms.  The more recent implementation uses the Xrl types and
marshalling is aimed at providing a more flexible interface to the
Finder and one that is easier to enhance.  The Xrl based finder has
recently become the default.  We are not presently aware of any
issues, but it possible to use the earlier code by running configure
with the --enable-original-finder flag.
