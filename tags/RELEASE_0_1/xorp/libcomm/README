This directory contains the COMM socket library.

This library includes a number of handy functions that
make it easier to perform various things with communication sockets:
open, close, bind to a local address and a port, join a multicast group, etc.
The library supports both IPv4 and IPv6.

The complete API to the library is in the "comm_api.h" file.
The API has two parts: the high-level `user' API, and the lower-lever
`sock' API. The lower-level API performs the particular operations on
a socket (e.g., join a multicast group on a socket).
The higher-level API usually combines several lower-level operations
together: e.g., open a socket, bind it to a multicast address and a port,
and join that multicast address.
