THE CODE IN THIS DIRECTORY IS EXPERIMENTAL AND STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT.

The tests in this directory and below use the rtrmgr to start the
protocols and should allow the testing of protocols interactions and
policy.

Before running the tests:
0) The tests assume that the bgp/harness binaries have been compiled,
'gmake check' in the bgp subdirectory will build the binaries.
1) Run "./install_templates.sh" this will take a copy of the template
files and modify them for use with the tests. For example one modification
is to substitute the FEA for the dummy FEA.
Note that this script uses the ed(1) text editor. If "ed" is not installed
by default (e.g., Fedora Core 5), it must be installed first.
2) Edit "test_builddir.py" and set the "BUILDDIR" variable to the top
of your build tree.
3) As root start the rtrmgr and test harness by running
"test_start.py", be aware that processes started by the rtrmgr are not
correctly terminated. So run "test_stop.py" and hit return in the
"test_start.py" window.
4) In a separate terminal run the tests for example "test_unh1.py" in
the bgp directory.
