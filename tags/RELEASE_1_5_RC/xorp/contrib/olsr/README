Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) Implementation
==================================================

This directory contains the XORP implementation of the OLSR protocol,
version 1, as specified in RFC 3626.

This work was generously funded by CenGen, Inc.

Documentation
=============

Full user documentation is available in TeX format, in the
xorp/docs/olsr directory. This may be used to produce PDF format files.

Building
========

OLSR for XORP should now be built as part of a main XORP build. To
enable the build and installation of OLSR, pass the "--with-olsr"
option when running "configure".

Testing
=======

To build and run regression tests, use "gmake check".

Status
======

September 2007: Initial development.
December 2007: Interim code drop of RFC-compliant OLSR with no XRL support.
January 2008: Preliminary release of RFC-compliant OLSR for IPv4.
April 2008: Merge to XORP mainline cvs.
