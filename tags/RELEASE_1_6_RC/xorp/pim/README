Protocol Independent Multicast-Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) Implementation
==================================================================

This directory contains the XORP implementation of the PIM-SM protocol.

Configuration
=============

PIM-SM like most XORP processes does not take its configuration
parameters from the command line. Its parameters are provided via
XRLs. At the very least a PIM-SM process must be provided with
the set of network interfaces to enable for multicast.

Startup
=======

In normal operation, PIM-SM would be started by the XORP router manager
process, not directly from the command line.
For information how to configure PIM-SM see
http://www.xorp.org/getting_started.html
or
http://www.xorp.org/releases/current/docs/user_manual/user_manual.pdf

To use PIM-SM, you must have PIM-capable kernel. Currently, the
following systems are known to have PIM-SM kernel support:

 - IPv4: DragonFlyBSD, FreeBSD-4.9, FreeBSD-5.2 (and later),
   NetBSD-3.0 (and later), OpenBSD-2.7 (and later), Linux:

   For DragonFlyBSD or FreeBSD kernel, the following options are required.
   Note that the PIM kernel option is not needed for FreeBSD-7.0 and later:
options		MROUTING		# Multicast routing
options		PIM			# PIM multicast routing

   For NetBSD kernel, the following options are required:
options         MROUTING        # IP multicast routing
options         PIM             # Protocol Independent Multicast

   For OpenBSD kernel, the following options are required:
option          MROUTING        # Multicast router
option          PIM             # Protocol Independent Multicast

   For Linux kernel, the following options are required:
CONFIG_IP_MULTICAST=y
CONFIG_IP_MROUTE=y
CONFIG_IP_PIMSM_V2=y

 - IPv6: DragonFlyBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD:
   No kernel options are required.

Documentation
=============

The PIM-SM design architecture and code structure are described in:
	${XORP}/docs/pim/

The programming documentation is in:
	${XORP}/docs/kdoc/html/pim/

Testing
=======

Currently, the PIM-SM testing is performed manually, by starting
PIM-SM on a number of testbed machines. All tests performed so far are
described in ${XORP}/docs/pim_testsuite/pim_testsuite.ps

In the future, automated testing will be added, similar to
the BGP testing framework.

Status
======

Currently (July 2008), the PIM-SM implementation is based
on the specification in the following documents:

 * draft-ietf-pim-sm-v2-new-11.{ps,txt} (The core PIM-SM specification).
 * draft-ietf-pim-sm-bsr-03.{ps,txt} (The Bootstrap mechanism).

The only major features not implemented yet are SSM support and security.

Many detailed tests have been performed so far
(see the "XORP PIM-SM Test Suite" document in ${XORP}/docs/pim_testsute/ or
http://www.xorp.org/design_docs.html), and the code appears
to be spec-compliant and robust, but no guarantees it is bug-free of course.
