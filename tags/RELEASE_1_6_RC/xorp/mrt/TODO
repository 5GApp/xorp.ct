* Clean-up the test_mrib program according to the new style.

* Add more tests to test_mrt to cover corner cases
  (e.g, listing all source or group entries by prefix 255.0.0.0/8, etc).

* Should remove() of Mrib entries remove them from the table, but
  should not delete the entries themselves?

* Do we want Mrt::start() and Mrt::stop() methods?
