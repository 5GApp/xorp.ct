This is XORPRTM; a loadable protocol DLL for Microsoft's Routing and
Remote Access Service. XORPRTM implements a named pipe server with
asynchronous I/O which translates Router Manager V2 events into
BSD routing socket messages, and vice versa.

Using this mechanism, XORP is able to participate fully in the exchange
of routes as part of Microsoft's Routing and Remote Access Server on
Windows Server 2003 and Windows 'Longhorn' Server.
