The script get-prefixes uses zebra-dump-parser.pl to generate an ascii
MRT RIB file from where route prefixes are extracted.  It appears that
each RIB file from archives.routeviews.org contains a single pass over
the RIB.

You may notice in the generated text file that there is a timestamp
file, as far as I can discern this is just a second timer and varies
because the dump takes so long to do.  There's also a view field, but
that always appears to be zero.

NB zebra-route-parser.pl didnt run out of the box on the versions of
perl installed locally (5.6 and 5.005).  The gripe appears to be in
the unpacking of attributes so the offending portion of code is
commented out.  It does not have any material impact AFAIK.

The data in the directory ../data are taken from dumps available at
http://archive.routeviews.org/bgpdata/.
