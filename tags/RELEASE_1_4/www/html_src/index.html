<h1> Welcome to XORP </h1>

<p> XORP is the eXtensible Open Router Platform.

<p>Our <a href="xorp_vision.html">goal</a> is to develop an open
source software router platform that is stable and fully featured
enough for <a href="xorp_vision.html#operators">production use</a>,
and flexible and extensible enough to enable <a
href="xorp_vision.html#research">network research</a>.  <a
href="status.html">Currently</a> XORP implements routing protocols for
IPv4 and IPv6 and a unified means to configure them.  In future, we
would also like to support <a href="xorp_vision.html#vendors">custom
hardware</a> and software forwarding architectures.

<p>XORP is free. It is covered by a BSD-style <a
href="license.html">license</a> and is publicly available for
research, development, and use.

<p> The core team is based at the <a
href="http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu">International Computer Science
Institute</a> in Berkeley, California, but contributors come from
around the world.
