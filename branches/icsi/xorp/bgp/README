Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Implementation
============================================

This directory contains the XORP implementation of the BGP protocol.

Configuration
=============

BGP like most Xorp processes does not take its configuration
parameters from the command line. Its parameters are provided via
XRLs. At the very least a BGP process must be provided with its AS
number and its ID.

Startup
=======

In normal operation, bgp would be started by the XORP router manager
process, not directly from the command line.  

For testing and debugging purposes, BGP can be manually started.  The
Xorp BGP process assumes that a number of programs will be running
before it is started:

../libxipc/finder (or rtrmgr which includes a finder)
../rib/rib
../fea/fea

Structure
=========

The structure of the BGP code is described in ../docs/bgp/bgp.ps

Testing
=======

As with most XORP processes, running "gmake check" in the bgp
directory will run a set of validation checks.  Any new functionality
committed to bgp must come with it's own set of validation checks.

Status
======

Nov 2002: The core functionality of BGP is basically complete.  We
have a reasonable number of test suites available, but nowhere near
enough to be sure of correct operation in all cases.  Pretty much no
optional functionality is supported:

- No user-configurable filters are supported (but the internal code to
  hold and apply filters is operational).
- Confederations are not supported.
- Route Reflection is not supported.
- IPv6 is not supported (although most of the internal code is v6 capable).
- Route import from IGPs is not supported.
