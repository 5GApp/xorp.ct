This directory contains Makefile includes.  These are intended to help
with generating consistent documentation.  At present only three include
files exist:  Makefile.latex, Makefile.fig, and Makefile.doc.am

=============================================
Makefile.latex:

Makefile.latex assumes you have a directory containing a latex file
for each Postscript and PDF file you wish to generate.  Your Makefile
needs to look like:
      
      LATEX_SOURCES=doc1.tex
      include $(MKDIR)/Makefile.latex

The Makefile uses latex/dvips to generate Postscript and pdflatex to
generate PDF.

=============================================
Makefile.fig:

If the document contains graphics, we assume the graphicx package is
used and that raw .fig files exist in a directory called "figs" that
is under the latex source directory.  Using graphicx allows documents
to include either Postscript or PDF files and to pull in the correct
file type for Postscript and PDF files depending on whether latex or
pdflatex are being run.  Files are included without their file type
suffix within the latex document, eg.

       \begin{figure}
         \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{figs/circles}}
         \caption{\label{fig:circles} Beautiful round circles. }
       \end{figure}

In the "figs" directory, the Makefile only need set the variable
FIG_SOURCES and include Makefile.fig.  Postscript and PDF files are
generated for each .fig file.

=============================================
Makefile.doc.am:

Makefile.doc.am is an alternative to the above Makefile.latex and
Makefile.fig. It is suppose to be used with Makefile.am files.
Currently, the Makefile.am should contain the following:

 * DOCS: the list of documents.

 * For each document foo in "DOCS" there should be the foo_LATEX with
   the Latex and Bibtex files for that document. Note that the
   main Latex file for document foo MUST be named foo.tex. Otherwise,
   we would have to introduce additional semantics to Makefile.am.

 * All figures for that document should be listed in foo_FIGURES.
   A file with a figures can be in any directory, and the file name
   can have any extention, though it is recommended that all files
   should be Encapsulated Postscript (i.e., *.eps). If a file extention
   is *.eps or *.ps and if there is a correspoding *.fig file in the
   same directory, then the *.eps or *.ps file will be regenerated
   whenever the *.fig file is modified: if the listed file name is *.eps,
   the regenerated file will be Encapsulated Postscript; if the listed
   file name is *.ps, the regenerated file will be Postscript.

 * Note that the only Postscript files "gmake clean" would remove are
   the foo.ps final documents, hence it is safe to have other *.ps files
   in the directory with the Latex source files. Though, it is recommended
   that all figures are in a subdirectory; for Xorp, the common
   convention is that directory name to be "figs".
   Other files that "gmake clean" removes are:
     - all foo.pdf final documents
     - all files with suffix *.aux *.bbl *.blg *.dvi *.log

Example of a Makefile.am file that uses Makefile.doc.am:

## Process this file with automake to produce Makefile.in.

include $(top_srcdir)/docs/mk/Makefile.doc.am

# -- Document Names
DOCS			= mydoc

# -- Document Sources
mydoc_LATEX		= mydoc.bib mydoc.tex
mydoc_FIGURES	=						\
			figs/fig1.eps				\
			figs/fig2.eps
