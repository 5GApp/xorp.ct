Forwarding Engine Abstraction
=============================

The FEA is intended to fulfill several roles:

    1) it manages network interfaces.

    2) it reports changes to network interface configurations.

    3) it manages the forwarding tables of the underlying forwarding plane.

    4) it allows UDP and RAW packets to be sent from network interfaces.

Documentation
=============

The FEA architecture is described in xorp/docs/fea.

Status
======

Two FEA implementations exist: fea_dummy and fea_rtsock.  fea_rtsock
is an FEA for systems implementing FreeBSD's routing socket interface.
It has been developed and tested on FreeBSD versions 4.5--4.7.
fea_dummy is a functional FEA substitute for other systems.  Neither
FEA version is extensively tested.
