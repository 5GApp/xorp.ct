* Clean-up the test programs according to the new style.

* Shoud remove() of Mrib entries remove them from the table, but
  should not delete the entries themselves?

* Rename _rpf_router_addr to _next_hop_router_addr

* Rename _vif_index to _next_hop_vif_index

* Do we want mrt->start() mrt->stop() and mrt->reset() functions?
