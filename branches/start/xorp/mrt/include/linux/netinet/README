This directory contains Linux include fixup files.

Linux doesn't have <netinet/ip_mroute.h>. Instead, it has <linux/mroute.h>.
Well, including <linux/mroute.h> together with <netinet/in.h> results in
errors, because <linux/mroute.h> includes <linux/in.h>, and including
both <netinet/in.h> and <linux/in.h> is a hell of a compilation mess-up.
Hopefully it will be fixed in future Linux distributions.
