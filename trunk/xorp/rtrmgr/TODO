Urgent
======

Configure Mode

 - Implement node locking in MasterConfigTree
 - Use node locking to prevent two users editing the same node.
 - Templates need %delete commands adding.
 - Can't delete leaf nodes.
    - Can delete some leaf nodes, but the xorpsh thinks there are still 
      uncommitted changes.
 - Implement $(@.DEFAULT) varname.
 - In xorpsh, variable expansion can fail (for example with FEA
   transation IDs).  Currently the xorpsh-side checks are disabled in
   slave_config_tree.cc, but this is the wrong solution to the
   problem.
 - Implement the "help" and "quit" commands in the top-level xorpsh
   command tree.


Operational Mode

 - Ensure commands only appear when modules are loaded.


Non-Urgent
==========

General

 - user database needs proper implementation of capabilities
 - Sort-out all *.hh files as appropriate to Makefile.am foo_SOURCE,
   and list all *.cc files there in alphabetical order

Configure Mode

 - Rollback when a commit fails.
 - Allow more flexible syntax in text_entry_mode.
 - Add support for "%setting" command.

Operational Mode



Done
====

 - Remove 5 second timeout.
 - Interruption of commands in progress.
   RESOLVED: Use Ctrl-C to interrupt xorpsh waiting for command completion.
 - If rtrmgr restarts, xorpsh will talk to the new rtrmgr, but will
   fail all authentication checks.  Handle this more gracefully.

RESOLVED: restart is detected and user is advised to logout and login again.  

 - TemplateTree destructor doesn't clean up properly.

RESOLVED: actually it was correct, the comment was wrong.

 - Module unloading when relevant config is deleted. (Done)
