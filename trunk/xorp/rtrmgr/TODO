Urgent
======

Configure Mode

 - Implement node locking in MasterConfigTree
 - Use node locking to prevent two users editing the same node.
 - Templates need %delete commands adding.
 - Can't delete leaf nodes.
    - Can delete some leaf nodes, but the xorpsh thinks there are still
      uncommitted changes.
 - Implement $(@.DEFAULT) varname.
 - In xorpsh, variable expansion can fail (for example with FEA
   transation IDs).  Currently the xorpsh-side checks are disabled in
   slave_config_tree.cc, but this is the wrong solution to the
   problem.
 - Implement the "help" and "quit" commands in the top-level xorpsh
   command tree.

Operational Mode

 - Ensure commands only appear when modules are loaded.

Other
 - Fix test_router_manager, because even if the path to the xorp_finder
   binary is incorrect, it doesn't report an error.

 - Restart code is broken, currently exits because of an Xrl failure
   when xorp_rtrmgr goes away.  Want to stick around, announce absence
   of xorp_rtrmgr and gracefully re-connect when it restarts.

Non-Urgent
==========

General

 - user database needs proper implementation of capabilities
 - Sort-out all *.hh files as appropriate to Makefile.am foo_SOURCE,
   and list all *.cc files there in alphabetical order
 - When the rtrmgr is running in no-exec mode do not instantiate a
   finder and XrlRouter.

Configure Mode

 - Rollback when a commit fails.
 - Allow more flexible syntax in text_entry_mode.
 - Add support for "%setting" command.

Operational Mode

Done
====

 - Remove 5 second timeout.
 - Interruption of commands in progress.
   RESOLVED: Use Ctrl-C to interrupt xorpsh waiting for command completion.
 - If rtrmgr restarts, xorpsh will talk to the new rtrmgr, but will
   fail all authentication checks.  Handle this more gracefully.

RESOLVED: restart is detected and user is advised to logout and login again.

 - TemplateTree destructor doesn't clean up properly.

RESOLVED: actually it was correct, the comment was wrong.

 - Module unloading when relevant config is deleted. (Done)
