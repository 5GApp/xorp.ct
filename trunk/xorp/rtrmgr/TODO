Urgent
======

Configure Mode

 - There are lots of hard-coded values in master_conf_tree.cc
 - Implement node locking in MasterConfigTree
 - Use node locking to prevent two users editing the same node.
 - Templates need %delete commands adding.
 - Can't delete leaf nodes.
    - Can delete some leaf nodes, but the xorpsh thinks there are still
      uncommitted changes.
 - In xorpsh, variable expansion can fail (for example with FEA
   transation IDs).  Currently the xorpsh-side checks are disabled in
   slave_config_tree.cc, but this is the wrong solution to the
   problem.
 - Implement the "help" and "quit" commands in the top-level xorpsh
   command tree.
 - The parsing of the return arguments of %modinfo status_method xrl method
   is still hardcoded in task.cc: "status:u32&reason:txt"
   The status decoding should be completely based on the template
   specification.

Operational Mode
 - Fix the CLI command completion for optional parameters:
   if an optional parameter is typed, then the list of optional parameters
   should not be shown again after it.
 - Change MasterConfigTree::parse() to return error message string
   by reference.
 - If signal SIGSTOP is delivered to a child process
   (e.g., by kill -STOP <pid>), the child process will properly deliver
   SIGCHLD to its parent process (i.e., the rtrmgr). Then the parent
   process SIGCHLD handler (function child_handler() in module_manager.cc)
   will properly set the child module status to stalled by
   calling set_stalled() for the corresponding module.
   However, if then we send signal SIGCONT to that child process,
   then the child process will NOT deliver SIGCHLD to the rtrmgr.
   As a result, the rtrmgr won't know that the child status is
   not stalled anymore.
   Find a solution of that problem. E.g., one possibility is that
   every child process should have a handler for the SIGCONT signals,
   and then it should explicitly deliver SIGCHLD signal to its parent
   process (the rtrmgr).

Other
 - Whenever we deal with configuration trees, use
   add_default_children() in a single place to add the defaults
   from the template tree rather than doing so every time we
   create a configuration tree from somewhere (e.g., file, xorpsh, etc).
 - Fix test_router_manager, because even if the path to the xorp_finder
   binary is incorrect, it doesn't report an error.
 - Assuming the following paragraph refers to the xorpsh this may be fixed.
   Restart code is broken, currently exits because of an Xrl failure
   when xorp_rtrmgr goes away.  Want to stick around, announce absence
   of xorp_rtrmgr and gracefully re-connect when it restarts.
 - Add support for commenting-out large blocks of user config files even
   if those files may contain /* ... */ comments inside.

Non-Urgent
==========

General

 - User database needs proper implementation of capabilities.
 - When the rtrmgr is running in no-exec mode do not instantiate a
   finder and XrlRouter.
 - Implement an %update method to the rtrmgr templates to deal
   with changing configuration on-the-fly. However, this is
   a short-term solution and should not be used by new protocols.
 - Start using the start/end XRL transaction mechanism to update
   configuration changes on-the-fly. After all processes start using
   this mechanism, then deprecate the %update and %activate methods.

Configure Mode

 - Rollback when a commit fails.
 - Allow more flexible syntax in text_entry_mode.
 - Add support for "%setting" command.
 - Check whether UNIX shell environment $EDITOR exists and is a valid
   command. If "yes", then fire the editor, create a temporary file,
   then apply "diff" on the configuration changes (or something like this).
 - Check whetner UNIX shell environment $PAGER exists and is a valid
   command. If "yes", then pipe the output through it instead of
   the built-in pager.
 - Add facility to redirect the log messages to a file with filename that
   is configurable within the XORP config file.

Operational Mode
 - Add template specification for "show" output: fields formatting, etc.

Done
====

 - Remove 5 second timeout.
 - Interruption of commands in progress.
   RESOLVED: Use Ctrl-C to interrupt xorpsh waiting for command completion.
 - If rtrmgr restarts, xorpsh will talk to the new rtrmgr, but will
   fail all authentication checks.  Handle this more gracefully.
 - Sort-out all *.hh files as appropriate to Makefile.am foo_SOURCE,
   and list all *.cc files there in alphabetical order
 - Implement $(@.DEFAULT) varname.

RESOLVED: restart is detected and user is advised to logout and login again.

 - TemplateTree destructor doesn't clean up properly.

RESOLVED: actually it was correct, the comment was wrong.

 - Module unloading when relevant config is deleted. (Done)
 - Get rid of the printf() in master_conf_tree.cc and elsewhere.
   At least, the info should be printed only if in debug mode.
 - Change the behavior of command-line option "-d" from "Display defaults"
   to "Enable debug output" (for both the rtrmgr and xorpsh).
RESOLVED: "-d" is removed, because it is redundant (the same info
   is printed by "-h"). The new command-line option to print
   verbose output is "-v".
 - Modify the *.cmds templates syntax to allow specification of the CLI
   help per command.
 - Ensure commands only appear when modules are loaded.
