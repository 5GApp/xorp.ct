Multicast Listener Discovery/Internet Group Management Protocol
(MLD/IGMP) Implementation
===============================================================

This directory contains the XORP implementation of the MLD and IGMP protocols.

Configuration
=============

MLD/IGMP like most Xorp processes does not take its configuration
parameters from the command line. Its parameters are provided via
XRLs. At the very least a MLD/IGMP process must be provided with
the set of network interfaces to enable for multicast.

Startup
=======

In normal operation, MLD/IGMP would be started by the XORP router manager
process, not directly from the command line.  

For testing and debugging purposes, MLD/IGMP can be manually started.  The
Xorp MLD6/IGMP process assumes that the XRL finder and the MFEA
are already running. However, the binary program ``test_mld6igmp'' already
contains them as well, therefore it is sufficient to start only this
program (as a root).

After ``test_mld6igmp'' is started, the MFEA and MLD/IGMP are
disabled by default. To start them, and to configure their operation,
as well as the MLD/IGMP operation, run script ``configure_mld6igmp''.
Note that it MUST be run from the ``mld6igmp'' directory.

However, before running ``configure_mld6igmp'', you must configure
it for each router:

 - Add an entry for each router under "case $HOSTNAME in" with the
   set of network interfaces to enable.
   Example:

	xorp1)
	ENABLE_VIFS="dc1 dc2 dc4"
	;;

 - By default, ``test_mld6igmp'' will log all protocol-related messages.
   To disable them, comment-out the following variables:

	MFEA_ENABLE_LOG_TRACE=yes
	MLD6IGMP_ENABLE_LOG_TRACE=yes

 - After MLD6IGMP is started, if you want to send a single XRL command
   to it and change some of its configuration, you can use the command
   ./command_mld6igmp <xrl_command> [xrl_command_arguments ... ]
   
   The list of all XRL commands and their arguments are in
   ``xrl_mld6igmp_shell_funcs.sh''

 - After MLD/IGMP is started, if you want to access its internal
   information, you can use the built-in CLI:
     telnet localhost 12000

 - If you want to enable access from other subnets, add the corresponding
   subnet to the following variable in ``configure_mld6igmp'':

	CLI_ENABLE_SUBNETS="127.0.0.1/32 192.150.187.0/25"


   Currently, the CLI supports primarily "show" commands. For example,
   "show igmp interface" will show the list of all interfaces known to
   IGMP and their status. At each moment you can press <TAB> for the
   list of existing commands at each level, and a brief description
   of them. Command-line editing is similar to tcsh: e.g., Ctrl-A and
   Ctrl-E to go to the beginning or end of the current line, Ctrl-A
   to kill the remaining part of the current line, etc.
   To exit, press Ctrl-D when you are on a new empty line.

Documentation
=============

The MLD/IGMP design architecture and code structure are described in:
	$(XORP)/docs/mld6igmp/

The programming documentation is in:
	$(XORP)/docs/kdoc/html/mld6igmp/

Testing
=======

Currently, the MLD/IGMP testing is performed manually, by starting
MLD/IGMP on a number of testbed machines.

In the future, automated testing will be added, similar to
the BGP testing framework.

Status
======

Currently (June 2003), the MLD/IGMP implementation is based
on the specification in the following documents:

 * RFC 2710: Multicast Listener Discovery for IPv6, Version 1
 * RFC 2236: Internet Group Management Protocol, Version 2

However, only IGMP has been tested.
