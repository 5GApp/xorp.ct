* Do we need to include <asm/types.h> for Linux, when we include
  <linux/rtnetlink.h> ?

* Fix test files like test_ifconfig_rtsock.cc

* Sync by renaming all "IfTree& iftree" to "IfTree& it" (or vice-versa).

* When start/stop multicast routing, call start_pim/stop_pim XRL as well.

* Implement following methods and their friends:
  - set_allow_kernel_signal_messages(bool v)
  - set_allow_mrib_messages(bool v)

* Set the pif_index for MfeaVif

* When obtaining the forwarding table from the kernel,
  do we need to take special care of the
  (rtm->rtm_flags & RTF_LLINFO) entries? (see the mfea code for that).

* Explicitly enable forwarding with sysctlbyname("net.inet.ip.forwarding"),
  or whatever other mechanism exists:
    size_t enable = 1;
    sysctlbyname("net.inet.ip.forwarding", 0, 0, &enable, sizeof(enable))

* Make sure that the interfaces in the interface tree are deleted properly
  whenever the underlying interfaces in the kernel change. E.g.,
  especially be careful in case an interface disappears, and immediately
  after that a new interface with different name but same interface index
  appears. In that case, we need to update properly the local cache
  that maps interface names to indexes.

* Add UDP interfaces for sending and receiving.

* Resurrect click based FEA.

* Write native Linux (netlink) based FEA.

* The following files inside "fea" are not used?
  click.hh click_glue.hh fti_click.hh ifconfig_click.hh
  click.cc fea_click.cc test_fea.cc test_fti.cc test_ifmanager.cc
  Refactor them?
