<P>
See the <a href="index.html">software overview</a> for details of the XORP processes.
<P>
As of Release 0.1 (December 2002), the status is as follows:
<DL>
<DT><B>RIB</B>

<DD>Release 0.1: The basic RIB is complete.  There are probably still many
bugs but the core is reasonably stable. IPv4 and IPv6 are supported,
and both unicast and multicast routes can be stored.  There's no
external way to monitor what's going on.  While regular BGP nexthop
resolution using IGP data works, recursive nexthop resolution does not
work.  Route redistribution from one routing protocol to another
doesn't yet work.

<DT><B>FEA</B>

<DD>Release 0.1: The FEA for FreeBSD is basically complete.  The FEA for
Click doesn't currently work.  The FEA for Linux doesn't exist.

<P>
<DT><B>MFEA</B>
<DD>For the time being, multicast routing is handled by a separate FEA.
<P>
Release 0.1: The Multicast FEA for FreeBSD and Linux is basically complete.
The MFEA for Click doesn't exist.

<P>
<DT><B>BGP</B>

<DD>Release 0.1: The core of BGP is basically complete.  There are
probably still many bugs but the core is reasonably stable.  
<P>
There are <B>no</B> features.  You can't monitor what's going on.  You
can't install any optional filters, which means in practice it isn't
too useful.  Redistribution of routes into BGP and origination of
routes currently work.  IPv4 routing works.  IPv6 doesn't, but the
core of the architecture is IPv6-ready.

<P>
<DT><B>OSPF</B>

<DD>Release 0.1: A reasonably complete port of OSPFd to the XORP
environment exists, but it hasn't been well enough tested to know if
it works or doesn't work.

<P>
<DT><B>RIP</B>

<DD>Release 0.1: Port to XORP not yet done.

<P>
<DT><B>IS-IS</B>

<DD>Not yet started.

<P>
<DT><B>PIM-SM</B>

<DD>Release 0.1: The PIM-SM implementation (including the Bootstrap mechanism)
is reasonably complete, but testing continues.  The code is not yet
stable. The SSM support is not yet started.

<P>
<DT><B>IGMP</B>

<DD>Release 0.1: The IGMPv1 and v2 implementation is reasonably complete, but
testing continues.  The IGMPv3 implementation is not yet started.

<P>
<DT><B>MLD</B>

<DD>Release 0.1: The MLDv1 implementation is reasonably complete, but
testing continues.  The MLDv2 implementation is not yet started.

<P>
<DT><B>Rtrmgr and Xorpsh Command Line Interface</B>

<DD>Release 0.1: The rtrmgr is capable of starting up and using xorpsh, a
user can reconfigure the XORP processes that comprise a
router. However, the code is not yet stable.  Operational mode
(monitoring a running router) is work in progress.

<P>
<DT><B>LibXIPC</B>

<DD>Release 0.1: The XRL inter-process communication code is stable and
working very well, but many functional enhancements are in progress
that will improve performance and flexibility.
<P>
<DT><B>SNMP</B>

<DD>Not yet started.
