<P>
See the <a href="index.html">software documentation</a> for details of the
XORP processes.
<P>
As of March 2003 (Release 0.2), the status is as follows:
<DL>
<DT><B>RIB</B>

<DD>The basic RIB is complete.  There are probably still many
bugs but the core is reasonably stable. IPv4 and IPv6 are supported,
and both unicast and multicast routes can be stored.  There's no
external way to monitor what's going on.  While regular BGP nexthop
resolution using IGP data works, recursive nexthop resolution does not
work.  Route redistribution from one routing protocol to another
doesn't yet work.

<DT><B>FEA</B>

<DD>The FEA for FreeBSD and the dummy FEA for testing purposes are
basically complete .  The FEA for Click doesn't currently work.  The
FEA for Linux doesn't exist.

<P>
<DT><B>MFEA</B>
<DD>For the time being, multicast routing is handled by a separate FEA.
The Multicast FEA for FreeBSD and Linux is basically complete.
The MFEA for Click doesn't exist.

<P>
<DT><B>BGP</B>

<DD>The core of BGP is basically complete, with respect to the
functionality described in draft-ietf-idr-bgp4-18.txt.  There are
probably still many bugs but the core is reasonably stable.
<P>
There are <B>no</B> optional features.  Monitoring is limited to
listing all the routes and listing all the peers - basically all the
information demanded by the base BGP MIB.  More fine-grain monitoring
is definitely needed.  You can't install any optional filters, which
means in practice it isn't too useful.  Redistribution of routes into
BGP and origination of routes currently don't work.  IPv4 routing
works.  IPv6 doesn't, but the core of the architecture is IPv6-ready.

<P>
<DT><B>OSPF</B>

<DD>A reasonably complete port of OSPFd to the XORP environment
exists, but it hasn't been well enough tested to know if it works or
doesn't work.  OSPFd is IPv4 only.

<P>
<DT><B>RIP</B>

<DD>Port to XORP not yet done.

<P>
<DT><B>IS-IS</B>

<DD>Not yet started.

<P>
<DT><B>PIM-SM</B>

<DD>The PIM-SM implementation (including the Bootstrap mechanism)
is reasonably complete and fairly well tested, though there are still
various minor things that need polishing.  The code appears stable, but
probably there are still some bugs. The SSM support is not yet started.

<P>
<DT><B>IGMP</B>

<DD>The IGMPv1 and v2 implementation is reasonably complete, but
testing continues.  The IGMPv3 implementation is not yet started.

<P>
<DT><B>MLD</B>

<DD>The MLDv1 implementation is reasonably complete, but
testing continues.  The MLDv2 implementation is not yet started.

<P>
<DT><B>Rtrmgr and Xorpsh Command Line Interface</B>

<DD>The rtrmgr is capable of starting up and using xorpsh, a user can
reconfigure the XORP processes that comprise a router. However, the
code is not yet stable.  Operational mode (monitoring a running
router) is work in progress, and limited to trivial monitoring of
interfaces and BGP.

<P>
<DT><B>LibXIPC</B>

<DD>The interfaces are stable, and the IPC mechanisms work well.  The
finder code from release 0.1 has been replaced with much nicer finder
design, which appears to be stable, but as with all new code there are
probably new bugs.
<P>
<DT><B>SNMP</B>

<DD>Not yet started.
