Since knowledge of how to contact the Finder is a necessary bootstrap
mechanism, each process should accept a command line argument to
specify the host and port to be used to contact the Finder.

Unless there are objections let's go with:

	-F <host>:<port>

and reserve:

	-K <key>

for the future use of secure transport protocols.
