\chapter*{Preface}

\vspace{-0.1in}
This User Manual describes the process of configuring and operating a
router running XORP.  At the time of writing, XORP is a
work-in-progress, and is evolving relatively quickly.  We hope this
user manual accurately reflects the functionality available in XORP,
but it is likely to date quite quickly.  An up-to-date copy of this
manual will always be available from {\it http://www.xorp.org/}.

\section*{Contributing to this Manual}
\vspace{-0.1in}
XORP is an open-source project, and this manual is an open-source
manual.  Like the XORP software, it is covered by the XORP license,
which permits you to modify it and use it for any purpose whatsoever,
so long as the copyright is preserved.  Please help us improve this
manual by sending contributions, suggestions, and criticism to {\it
