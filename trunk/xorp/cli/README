Command-Line Interface Implementation
============================================

This directory contains the XORP implementation of the CLI library.

Startup
=======

Typically, the CLI is used as part of the "xorpsh" process
(inside $XORP/rtrmgr/), but for debugging purpose any process
may enable direct CLI access.

After a process that provides direct CLI access is started, if you want
to access its internal information, you can use telnet to connect
to the built-in CLI:
     telnet localhost 12000
If you want to enable access from other subnets other than the local
host only, add lines similar to the following lines for each additional
subnet:

	IPvXNet enable_ipvxnet("10.10.10.0/24");
	cli_node4.add_enable_cli_access_from_subnet(enable_ipvxnet);
	IPvXNet disable_ipvxnet1("0.0.0.0/0");	// Disable everything else
	cli_node4.add_disable_cli_access_from_subnet(disable_ipvxnet1);


Currently, the CLI supports primarily "show" commands. For example,
"show pim interface" will show the list of all interfaces known to
PIM and their status. At each moment you can press <TAB> for the
list of existing commands at each level, and a brief description
of them. Command-line editing is similar to tcsh: e.g., Ctrl-A and
Ctrl-E to go to the beginning or end of the current line, Ctrl-A
to kill the remaining part of the current line, etc.
To exit, press Ctrl-D when you are on a new empty line.

Documentation
=============

Currently, the only available documentation is the source code itself.
In the future documentation will be added to describe the CLI architecture.

Testing
=======

Currently, the CLI testing is performed manually. See file ``TODO''
for a list of known problems.

Status
======

Currently (November 2003), the CLI implementation is reasonably
stable, but more tests are needed and there are still several minor
things that need fixing.
