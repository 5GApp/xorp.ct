Command-Line Interface Implementation
============================================

This directory contains the XORP implementation of the CLI library.

Startup
=======

The CLI library is used as part of the "xorpsh" process
(inside ${XORP}/rtrmgr/).

Documentation
=============

Please refer to ${XORP}/rtrmgr/ about information how to use the CLI
as part of the xorpsh.
Currently, the only available development documentation is the source
code itself. In the future documentation will be added to describe the
CLI architecture and API.

Testing
=======

Currently, the CLI testing is performed manually. See file ``TODO''
for a list of known problems.

Status
======

Currently (July 2008), the CLI implementation is reasonably
stable, but more tests are needed and there are still several minor
issues that need fixing.
