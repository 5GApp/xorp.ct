		    RIB: Routing Information Base.

The RIB acts as an exchange area for routes associated with different
routing protocols.  Each routing process can add, remove, query, and
register interest in routes.  The RIB arbitrates over the best
available route according the administrative distance associated with
the routing protocol that registered a particular route.  In addition,
the RIB propagates routes down to the Forwarding Engine Abstraction.

Configuration
=============

This serves as the plumbing between all the different unicast routing
protocols that may be running on a router.

Startup
=======

The RIB depends on the finder and should be started by the Router
Manager process.

Documentation
=============

The RIB design architecture and code structure are described in:
	${XORP}/docs/rib/

The programming documentation is in:
	${XORP}/docs/kdoc/html/rib/

Status
======

Tests run.
