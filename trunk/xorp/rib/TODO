RIB To Do List
=======================

1. ExtIntTable needs some re-writing to be more symetric so that
recursive BGP nexthop lookups are possible.

2. VIF configuration should be automatic, by communicating directly
with the FEA.

3. ExportTable needs a queue adding to rate control changes to the FEA
when the FEA is not keeping up.

4. ExportTable should amalgamate deletes and adds in its queue for the
same route.

5. RegisterServer should amalgamate deletes and adds in its queue for
the same route.  

6. RegisterServer should be smarter about the use of flush().

7. Route redistribution needs finishing.

8. Route filters are needed for route redistribution.

9. Change OriginTable to hold data rather than pointers in the Trie.

10. Better, more extensive test suites.

11. Add new interface for PIM simply be able to get all the routes.

12. Change virtual XrlCmdError rib_0_1_no_fea(); to enable/disable
    RIB clients.

13. Fix XrlRibTarget::rib_0_1_no_fea() to correspond to rib clients.

14. Rething the logic computing whether a route is directly connected
    (e.g., when we use Vif::is_same_subnet() or Vif::is_same_p2p()):
    if vif is down, then the route is NOT directly connected?

15. Make test_rib_client.cc work properly
