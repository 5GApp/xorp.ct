 * @short VifManager keeps track of the VIFs currently enabled in the FEA.

 * The RIB process has a single VifManager instance, which registers
 * with the FEA process to discover the VIFs on this router and their
 * IP addresses and prefixes. When the VIFs or their configuration in
 * the FEA change, the VifManager will be notified, and it will update
 * the RIBs appropriately. The RIBs need to know about VIFs and VIF
 * addresses to decide which routes have nexthops that are on directly
 * connected subnets, and which are nexthops that need to be resolved
 * using other routes to figure out where next to send the packet.
 * Only routes with nexthops that are on directly connected subnets
 * can be sent to the FEA.
