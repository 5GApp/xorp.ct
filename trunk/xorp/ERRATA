		XORP ERRATA

  ALL:
    - Parallel building (e.g., "gmake -j 4") may fail on multi-CPU machines.
      The simplest work-around is to rerun gmake or not to use the -j flag.
    - Overwriting the default installation prefix by running
      "./configure --prefix=/path/to/xorp" currently does not work.
      This will be fixed before XORP Release 1.0

  LIBXORP:
    - No known issues.

  LIBXIPC:
    - No known issues.

  LIBFEACLIENT:
    - No known issues.

  XRL:
    - No known issues.

  RTRMGR:
    - There are several known issues, but none of them is considered critical.
      The list of known issues is available from
      http://www.xorp.org/bugzilla/query.cgi

  XORPSH:
    - A problem was noticed very late in the release process; rather
      than delay the release we have choosen to document the
      problem. The xorpsh provides the command line to the XORP
      router. The router configuration is structured as a tree,
      for instance configuring a new protocol essentially adds a new
      node to the tree. Removing a protocol involves deleting a node
      from the tree. In some cases deleting a node does not remove all
      the associated state; worse putting the same node back seems to
      fail in the majority of cases.

  FEA/MFEA:
    - On Linux, the following error message may appear during graceful
      shutdown (if PIM-SM is also running):

        [ 2004/06/09 14:50:40  ERROR xorp_fea:14359 MFEA +1676
        mfea_mrouter.cc get_sg_count ] ioctl(SIOCGETSGCNT, (10.10.10.10
        224.0.1.20)) failed: Bad file descriptor

      The error is harmless and can be ignored.

  RIB: 
    - If an interface address is deleted, the RIB may trigger the following
      error in the FEA:

        [ 2004/06/07 16:08:57  ERROR xorp_fea:1605 FEA +259
        fticonfig_entry_set_rtsock.cc delete_entry ] error writing to
        routing socket: No such process
        [ 2004/06/07 16:08:57  ERROR xorp_fea:1605 FEA +61 fti_transaction.cc
        operation_result ] FTI transaction commit failed on DeleteEntry4: net =
        172.16.124.0/24 gateway = 0.0.0.0 ifname =  vifname
        =  metric = 0 admin_distance = 0 xorp_route = false is_deleted = false
        [ 2004/06/07 16:08:57  ERROR xorp_fea:1605 FEA +259

      This error has no side effects, and can be ignored.
    - In some rare cases, the RIB may fail to delete an existing route
      (See http://www.xorp.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=62).
      We are aware of the issue and will attempt to fix it in the near future.

  BGP:
    - No known issues.

  MLD/IGMP:
    - If MLD/IGMP is started with a relatively large number of interfaces
      (e.g., on the order of 20), then it may fail with the following error:

        [ 2004/06/14 12:58:56  ERROR test_pim:16548 MFEA +666
        mfea_proto_comm.cc join_multicast_group ] Cannot join group 224.0.0.2
        on vif eth8: No buffer space available

      The solution is to increase the multicast group membership limit.
      E.g., to increase the value from 20 (the default) to 200, run as a root:

        echo 200 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/igmp_max_memberships

  PIM-SM:
    - If the kernel does not support PIM-SM, or if PIM-SM is not enabled
      in the kernel, then running PIM-SM will fail with the following
      error message:
        [ 2004/06/12 10:26:41  ERROR xorp_fea:444 MFEA +529 mfea_mrouter.cc
        start_mrt ] setsockopt(MRT_INIT, 1) failed: Operation not supported

  CLI:
    - No known issues.

  SNMP:
    - net-snmp-5.1.* may have problems with some of its header files, hence
      the XORP SNMP support won't be compiled if those problems exist.
      Instead, use an earlier net-snmp version from the 5.0.x branch.

  RIP:
    - No known issues.
