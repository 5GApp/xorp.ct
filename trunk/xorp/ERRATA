  XORPSH:
    - A problem was noticed very late in the release process; rather
      than delay the release we have choosen to document the
      problem. The xorpsh provides the command line to the XORP
      router. The router configuration is structured as a tree,
      for instance configuring a new protocol essentially adds a new
      node to the tree. Removing a protocol involves deleting a node
      from the tree. In some cases deleting a node does not remove all
      the associated state; worse putting the same node back seems to
      fail in the majority of cases.
