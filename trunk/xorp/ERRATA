		XORP ERRATA

  ALL:
    - Parallel building (e.g., "gmake -j 4") may fail on multi-CPU machines.
      The simplest work-around is to rerun gmake or not to use the -j flag.

    - The following compiler is known to be buggy, and should not be used
      to compile XORP:
          gcc34 (GCC) 3.4.0 20040310 (prerelease) [FreeBSD]
      A newer compiler such as the following should be used instead:
          gcc34 (GCC) 3.4.2 20040827 (prerelease) [FreeBSD]

    - If you run BGP, RIB, FIB2MRIB, and PIM-SM at the same time,
      the propagation latency for the BGP routes to reach the kernel
      is increased. We are investigating the problem.

  LIBXORP:
    - No known issues.

  LIBXIPC:
    - No known issues.

  LIBFEACLIENT:
    - No known issues.

  XRL:
    - No known issues.

  RTRMGR:
    - There are several known issues, but none of them is considered critical.
      The list of known issues is available from
      http://www.xorp.org/bugzilla/query.cgi

    - Using the rtrmgr "-r" command-line option to restart processes that
      have failed does not work if a process fails while being reconfigured
      via xorpsh. If that happens, the rtrmgr itself may coredump.
      Therefore, using the "-r" command-line option is not recommended!
      Also, note that a process that has been killed by SIGTERM or SIGKILL
      will not be restarted (this is a feature rather than a bug).
      Ideally, we want to monitor the processes status using the finder
      rather than the forked children process status, therefore in
      the future when we have a more robust implementation the "-r"
      switch will be removed and will be enabled by default.

  XORPSH:

  FEA/MFEA:
    - On Linux with kernel 2.6 (e.g., RedHat FC2 with kernel 2.6.5-1.358),
      some of the tests may fail (with or without an error message),
      but no coredump image. Some of those failures can be contributed
      to a kernel problem. E.g., running "dmesg can show kernel
      "Oops" messages like:

Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000
 printing eip:
02235532

      This appears to be a kernel bug triggered by ioctl(SIOCGIFNAME)
      which itself is called by if_indextoname(3). Currently, there
      is no known solution of the problem except to use a kernel that does
      not have the problem (at this stage it is not known whether all
      2.6 Linux kernels are affected or only specific versions).
      It seems that a very similar problem has been reported to the
      Linux kernel developers, but the problem is still unsolved:

      https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=121697

    - The mechanism for tracking the network interface link status
      may not work for FreeBSD-5.2 and earlier, and for MacOS X,
      because the kernel for those systems does not provide a mechanism
      for asynchronous notification of userland programs when the link
      status changes. Though, for those systems the link status is read
      properly on startup.

  RIB: 
    - In some rare cases, the RIB may fail to delete an existing route
      (See http://www.xorp.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=62).
      We are aware of the issue and will attempt to fix it in the future.

  RIP:
    - No known issues.

  BGP:
    - If the RIB bug above (failure to delete an existing route) is
      triggered by BGP, then the deletion failure error received by
      BGP from the RIB is considered by BGP as a fatal error.
      This is not a BGP problem, but a RIB problem that will be fixed
      in the future.

    - The BGP configuration mandates that an IPv4 nexthop must be supplied.
      Unfortunately it is necessary to provide an IPv4 nexthop even for an
      IPv6 only peering. Even more unfortunately it is not possible to force
      the IPv6 nexthop.

    - It is *essential* for an IPv6 peering that an IPv6 nexthop is provided.
      Unfortunately the configuration does not enforce this requrement.
      This will be fixed in the future.

  STATIC_ROUTES:
    - No known issues.
      
  MLD/IGMP:
    - If MLD/IGMP is started with a relatively large number of interfaces
      (e.g., on the order of 20), then it may fail with the following error:

        [ 2004/06/14 12:58:56  ERROR test_pim:16548 MFEA +666
        mfea_proto_comm.cc join_multicast_group ] Cannot join group 224.0.0.2
        on vif eth8: No buffer space available

      The solution is to increase the multicast group membership limit.
      E.g., to increase the value from 20 (the default) to 200, run as a root:

        echo 200 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/igmp_max_memberships

  PIM-SM:
    - If the kernel does not support PIM-SM, or if PIM-SM is not enabled
      in the kernel, then running PIM-SM will fail with the following
      error message:
        [ 2004/06/12 10:26:41  ERROR xorp_fea:444 MFEA +529 mfea_mrouter.cc
        start_mrt ] setsockopt(MRT_INIT, 1) failed: Operation not supported

    - On Linux, if the unicast Reverse Path Forwarding information is
      different from the multicast Reverse Path Forwarding information,
      the Reverse Path Filtering should be disabled. E.g., as root:

        echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/rp_filter
      OR
        echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth0/rp_filter
        echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth1/rp_filter
        ...

      Otherwise, the router will ignore packets if they don't arrive on
      the reverse-path interface.
      For more information about Reverse Path Filtering see
      http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Adv-Routing-HOWTO/lartc.kernel.rpf.html

    - Currently, the PIM-SM implementation does not support unnumbered
      point-to-point links. Furthermore, even on numbered point-to-point
      links the next-hop information in the routing entries should use
      an IP address instead of an interface name. For example,
      if we have a GRE tunnel on Linux and if we want to add a route
      that uses that tunnel, we should use a command like:
        route add -net <target> gw <IP address of other side of GRE tunnel>
      instead of
        route add -net <target> <GRE interface name>

  FIB2MRIB:
    - No known issues.

  CLI:
    - No known issues.

  SNMP:
    - On some versions of Linux, there are some bugs in net-snmp versions
      5.0.8 and 5.0.9, which prevent dynamic loading from working.
      See http://www.xorp.org/snmp.html for links to the net-snmp patches
      that solve the problems.

    - Version 5.1 of net-snmp requires a simple modification, otherwise
      XORP will fail to compile.
      See http://www.xorp.org/snmp.html for a link to the net-snmp patch
      that solves the problems.
