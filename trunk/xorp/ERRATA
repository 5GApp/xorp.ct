		XORP ERRATA

  ALL:
    - Parallel building (e.g., "gmake -j 4") may fail on multi-CPU
      machines. The simplest work-around is to rerun gmake or not to use
      the -j flag.

    - The following compiler is known to be buggy, and should not be used
      to compile XORP:
        gcc34 (GCC) 3.4.0 20040310 (prerelease) [FreeBSD]
      A newer compiler such as the following should be used instead:
        gcc34 (GCC) 3.4.2 20040827 (prerelease) [FreeBSD]

    - If you run BGP, RIB, FIB2MRIB, and PIM-SM at the same time,
      the propagation latency for the BGP routes to reach the kernel
      is increased. We are investigating the problem.

  LIBXORP:
    - No known issues.

  LIBXIPC:
    - No known issues.

  LIBFEACLIENT:
    - No known issues.

  XRL:
    - No known issues.

  RTRMGR:
    - There are several known issues, but none of them is considered
      critical. The list of known issues is available from:

        http://www.xorp.org/bugzilla/query.cgi

    - Using the rtrmgr "-r" command-line option to restart processes
      that have failed does not work if a process fails while being
      reconfigured via xorpsh. If that happens, the rtrmgr itself may
      coredump. Therefore, using the "-r" command-line option is not
      recommended! Also, note that a process that has been killed by
      SIGTERM or SIGKILL will not be restarted (this is a feature rather
      than a bug). Ideally, we want to monitor the processes status
      using the finder rather than the forked children process status,
      therefore in the future when we have a more robust implementation
      the "-r" switch will be removed and will be enabled by default.

  XORPSH:
    - There are several known issues, but none of them is considered
      critical. The list of known issues is available from:

        http://www.xorp.org/bugzilla/query.cgi

  FEA/MFEA:
    - On Linux with kernel 2.6 (e.g., RedHat FC2 with kernel
      2.6.5-1.358), some of the tests may fail (with or without an error
      message), but no coredump image. Some of those failures can be
      contributed to a kernel problem. E.g., running "dmesg" can show
      kernel "Oops" messages like:

        Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual
        address 00000000 printing eip:
        ...

      This appears to be a kernel bug triggered by ioctl(SIOCGIFNAME)
      which itself is called by if_indextoname(3). Currently, there 
      is no known solution, but it appears the problem may have been
      fixed for more recent Linux kernel versions:

        https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=121697

    - The mechanism for tracking the network interface link status
      may not work for the following OS-es because the kernel for those
      systems does not provide a mechanism for asynchronous notification
      of userland programs when the link status changes: FreeBSD-5.2 and
      earlier and MacOS X (note: if the Windows kernel supports this
      feature, it is not used yet in XORP). Though, for those systems
      the link status should be read properly on startup.

  RIB:
    - In some rare cases, the RIB may fail to delete an existing route:

        http://www.xorp.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=62

      We are aware of the issue and will attempt to fix it in the
      future.

  RIP:
    - No known issues.

  OSPF:
    - There are several known issues, but none of them is considered
      critical. The list of known issues is available from:

        http://www.xorp.org/bugzilla/query.cgi

  BGP:
    - If the RIB bug above (failure to delete an existing route) is
      triggered by BGP, then the deletion failure error received by
      BGP from the RIB is considered by BGP as a fatal error. This is
      not a BGP problem, but a RIB problem that will be fixed in the
      future.

    - The BGP configuration mandates that an IPv4 nexthop must be
      supplied. Unfortunately it is necessary to provide an IPv4 nexthop
      even for an IPv6 only peering. Even more unfortunately it is not
      possible to force the IPv6 nexthop.

    - It is *essential* for an IPv6 peering that an IPv6 nexthop is
      provided. Unfortunately the configuration does not enforce this
      requrement. This will be fixed in the future.

  STATIC_ROUTES:
    - No known issues.
      
  MLD/IGMP:
    - If MLD/IGMP is started on Linux with a relatively large number of
      interfaces (e.g., on the order of 20), then it may fail with the
      following error:

        [ 2004/06/14 12:58:56  ERROR test_pim:16548 MFEA +666
        mfea_proto_comm.cc join_multicast_group ] Cannot join group
        224.0.0.2 on vif eth8: No buffer space available

      The solution is to increase the multicast group membership limit.
      E.g., to increase the value from 20 (the default) to 200, run as a
      root:

        echo 200 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/igmp_max_memberships

  PIM-SM:
    - If the kernel does not support PIM-SM, or if PIM-SM is not enabled
      in the kernel, then running PIM-SM will fail with the following
      error message:

        [ 2004/06/12 10:26:41  ERROR xorp_fea:444 MFEA +529 mfea_mrouter.cc
        start_mrt ] setsockopt(MRT_INIT, 1) failed: Operation not supported

    - On Linux, if the unicast Reverse Path Forwarding information is
      different from the multicast Reverse Path Forwarding information,
      the Reverse Path Filtering should be disabled. E.g., as root:

        echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/rp_filter

      OR

        echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth0/rp_filter
        echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth1/rp_filter
        ...

      Otherwise, the router will ignore packets if they don't arrive on
      the reverse-path interface. For more information about Reverse
      Path Filtering see:

        http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Adv-Routing-HOWTO/lartc.kernel.rpf.html

    - Currently, the PIM-SM implementation does not support unnumbered
      point-to-point links. Furthermore, even on numbered point-to-point
      links the next-hop information in the routing entries should use
      an IP address instead of an interface name. For example,
      if there is a GRE tunnel on Linux and if we want to add a route
      that uses that tunnel, we should use a command like:

        route add -net <target> gw <IP address of other side of GRE tunnel>

      instead of:

        route add -net <target> <GRE interface name>

  FIB2MRIB:
    - No known issues.

  CLI:
    - No known issues.

  SNMP:
    - On some versions of Linux, there are some bugs in net-snmp
      versions 5.0.8 and 5.0.9, which prevent dynamic loading from
      working. See the following URL for links to the net-snmp
      patches that solve the problems:

        http://www.xorp.org/snmp.html

    - Version 5.1 of net-snmp requires a simple modification, otherwise
      XORP will fail to compile.
      See the following URL for a link to the net-snmp patch that solves
      the problems:
