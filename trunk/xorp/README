		XORP: eXtensible Open Router Platform



1. Overview
===========

XORP is an open router platform being developed at the ICSI Center for
Open Networking (ICON) at the International Computer Science Institute
in Berkeley, California, USA. XORP primary goal is to be both a research
tool and a stable deployment platform that can be used to close the gap
between network research and real world.

XORP design philosophy is:
  * modularity
  * extensibility
  * performance
  * robustness
This is achieved by carefully separating functionalities into
independent modules, and by providing an API for each module.

XORP divides into two subsystems. The higher-level ("user-level")
subsystem consists of the routing protocols. The lower-level ("kernel")
manages the forwarding path, and provides APIs for the higher-level to
access.

User-level XORP uses multi-process architecture with one process per
routing protocol, and a novel inter-process communication mechanism
called XRL (XORP Resource Locator). XRLs can be used across the network,
therefore XORP can in principle run in distributed fashion.  For
example, we can have a distributed router with the forwarding engine
running on one machine, and each of the routing protocols that update
the forwarding engine is running on a separate machine.

The lower-level subsystem can use traditional UNIX kernel forwarding, or
Click modular router. The modularity and independency of the lower-level
from the user-level subsystem allows for its easily replacement with
other solutions including high-end hardware-based forwarding engines.

For more information about XORP high-level design see the following
paper available from http://www.xorp.org/ :

2. Status
=========

This is alpha release, which means that it should be used for
nothing more than source code browsing, compilation, and simple testing.

Supported platforms:
  * FreeBSD-4.5-RELEASE and FreeBSD-4.6.2-RELEASE with:
    - gcc/g++ version 2.95.3 or 3.2.1
    - gmake (GNU make) version 3.79.1
    - autoconf version 2.13
    - automake version 1.4
    - flex version 2.5.4
    - yacc version default one that comes with the above OS
    Note that most of the development is done on FreeBSD-4.6.2-RELEASE,
    but most of the testing is done on FreeBSD-4.5-RELEASE.


Currently, XORP implements the following protocols:

  * BGP4:
   - draft-ietf-idr-bgp4-18.txt

  * PIM-SM:
    - draft-ietf-pim-sm-v2-new-05.{ps,txt} (without SSM).
    - draft-ietf-pim-sm-bsr-03.{ps,txt}

  * IGMP v1 and v2:
    - RFC 2236

  * MLD v1 (not tested yet):
    - RFC 2710


3. Compilation, configuration and startup
============================

To compile xorp, you must have GNU make (gmake) installed. Then just
run the following commands in the top-level directory:

./configure
gmake

At this stage you should not expect to use the XORP code for other
purposes than studying its architecture and running simple tests.

In general, configuration and startup of the various XORP processes are
normally meant to happen via the router manager (rtrmgr), so please
refer to the rtrmgr documentation in the first place ($XORP/docs/rtrmgr/),
and then the documentation of the individual modules.


4. Code structure and documentation
===================================

The code is split into several directories, each containing libraries,
components or implementation of the various XORP modules. Documentation
for each of them is available in one or more of the following places:

  * the README file in each directory

  * kdoc-generated documentation, created with the script

	xorp/docs/kdoc/gen-kdoc.sh

    whose output goes into

	xorp/docs/kdoc/html/<modulename>/

  * a high level architecture overview, available in

	xorp/docs/<modulename>

The content of each of the directory is the following:

  * bgp : BGP implementation.

  * cli : CLI (Command-Line Interface) library.
    It is used by the Router Manager (rtrmgr), and by some of the
    multicast code (mfea, mld6igmp, pim).

  * docs : XORP user documentation.

  * etc : Various XORP-related files (e.g., configuration, templates).

  * fea : Forwarding Engine Abstraction.
    The FEA implements the interface between XORP and the underlying
    forwarding engine (e.g., the UNIX kernel). Currently, it is used
    for unicast only.

  * libcomm : Communication socket library.
    Currently, it is used only by the cli.

  * libproto : Abstract protocol library.
    Used by the following modules/directories: cli, mfea, mld6igmp, pim.

  * libxipc : XRL (XORP Resource Locator) library and XRL-related
    programs.

  * libxorp : XORP library that contains various basic
    functionalities such as IP addresses, IP subnets, etc.

  * mfea : Multicast Forwarding Engine Abstraction.
    The MFEA implements the multicast interface between XORP and
    the underlying forwarding engine. Note that in the future it
    may become part of the FEA.

  * mld6igmp : Multicast Listen Discovery/Internet Group Management
    Protocol (MLD/IGMP) implementation.

  * mrt : Various multicast-related code.
    Used by the following modules/directories: mfea, mld6igmp, pim.

  * pim : Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM)
    implementation.

  * policy : Policy-related library. Currently, it is work in progress,
    and is not used yet.

  * rib : Routing Information Base.
    It is used to store the routing information from various protocols.

  * rtrmgr : Router Manager.
    It is used to manage and configure all XORP components.

  * xrl : XRL (XORP Resource Locator) interface.

The directories listed below contain various information that are of
limited interest, or are not relevant to the current release:

  * config : autoconf/automake related files.

  * devnotes : various notes for the XORP core members.

  * ospfd : John Moy's OSPFd implementation. Not supported with this
    release.

  * rip : FreeBSD's RIP and RIPng implementation. Not supported with
    this release.

  * utils : Various XORP-related utilities.


5. Future plans
===============

In the short-term we plan to add:
  * IPv6 support
  * OSPF
  * RIP
  * Click forwarding path
  * Security
  * MLD

  * IS-IS
  * BGMP
