/**
 * @short Policy filters which support versioning [i.e. keep old version].
 *
 * The idea is to create a new policy filter on each configuration.  Whenever a
 * route is being processed, you read which filter to run.  If this filter is 0,
 * [null pointer] then give it the last configuration.  Else just run whatever
 * filter is returned.
 *
 * Filters should be referenced counted by routes.  When reference count reaches
 * 0, it should be deleted.
 *
 * Why not keep filters internally here and read a filter id from route?  Well
 * because we cannot assume when to increment and decrement the reference count.
 * Say it's a normal route lookup and we do the filtering, and it results to
 * "accepted".  It doesn't imply we need to +1 the reference count.
