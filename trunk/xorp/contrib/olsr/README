Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) Implementation
==================================================

This directory contains the XORP implementation of the OLSR protocol,
version 1, as specified in RFC 3626.

Configuration
=============

Startup
=======

Documentation
=============

Please note: The use of the undirected broadcast address 255.255.255.255
is inconsistent across host IPv4 stacks. Currently it is known to work
only under Linux, using the SO_BINDTODEVICE option. Future revisions of
this code will use the pcap facilities integrated into the FEA to support
a wider variety of platforms.

Testing
=======

To build and run regression tests, use "jam -dMAKE_CHECK=1".

Status
======

September 2007: Initial development.
December 2007: Interim code drop of RFC-compliant OLSR with no XRL support.
January 2008: Preliminary release of RFC-compliant OLSR for IPv4.
