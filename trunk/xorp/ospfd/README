ospfd:  This in John Moy's OSPFd.  Origin site is http://www.ospf.org/

src subdir is the basic OSPF code
ospf_sim is Moy's build environment to run ospf as a simulator.
linux is Moy's support code to run ospfd directly under Linux.

On xorp, when porting for different platforms you will need to create
a directory for the target platform and a machdep.h there with
platform specific dependencies.  Look at {linux,freebsd}/machdep.h for
starting points.  The other files in the linux and freebsd directories
are redundant.
