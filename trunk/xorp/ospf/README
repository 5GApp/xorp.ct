*** THIS CODE IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND CANNOT BE USED FOR ROUTING. ***

* In the interface code currently Peer, Peerout and Neightbour classes
  never cache any state such as router ID or area. We use the hello
  packet to hold the definitive state for this peerings. If the router
  ID or some other state is changed then the new values should be
  adopted immediately in any outbound packets.

* Always change the state as the first operation in an event
  routine. If any subsequent code checks the state it should see the
  new state.

* In the interface code various state variables need to be held. A lot
  of this state will eventually be transmitted. Hold as much as
  possible of this state in a packet (HelloPacket) itself. Saves the
  additional copy and reduces the likelyhood of getting out of sync.
