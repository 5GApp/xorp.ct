1) None of the packet decode routines check the type field in the header
against their own type field. Could probably put the approriate check
in the standard header decode code.

2) I don't think that the LSA routines check their own type field either.

3) The Network Mask field in OSPFv2 hello packets currently we seem to
be setting an index not a mask, check the spec to see what we should
be doing.

4) The MTU is not being set in the data description packet.
