TODO
~~~~

1) None of the packet decode routines check the type field in the header
against their own type field. Could probably put the approriate check
in the standard header decode code.

2) I don't think that the LSA routines check their own type field either.

3) The Network Mask field in OSPFv2 hello packets currently we seem to
be setting an index not a mask, check the spec to see what we should
be doing.

4) The LsaDecoder should have a method that can be used to check if LS
types are valid. This method should be used by data_description_received.

5) Are external-LSAs allowed in NSSAs?

7) Can an interface a peer in our code have more than one subnet
associated with it?

8) Constructor for the AreaRouter should take all the information to
fill in the Router LSA.

9) Figure out under what conditions the E-bit should be set.

10) Section 3.3 Classification of routers. Add an OSPF enumeration for the
four classifications. Note that the classifications are
overlappying. Add four predicate methods to the peer manager that will
return the status of the router. For example if the router is only
configured with one area internal_router_p will return true.

12) Point 2 Point and Point 2 Multipoint.
When coding this we will need to be told neigbour addresses. When we
are told them just create the neighbour structures and we should be
done. Need to be careful that we don't destroy the neighbour
structures when the timers expire.

13) Provide a mechanism to set the interface prefix length. Checkout
get_interface_prefix_length().

14) Provide a mechanism to set the interface cost. Checkout
get_interface_cost().

15) The router ID and area ID are held as IPv4 this is fine but
remember that IPv4::addr() returns in the network byte order not
host. Therefore fields that are defined as uint32_t in packets that
are set from a get_router_id() call need to have ntohl() called on
them.

Possible issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) Received hello packets are demultiplex on the source address of the
packet or on the router ID, depending on the linktype that the packet
arrived on. If a packet is being demultipled on the source address and
the router ID changes is this likely to be a problem?
