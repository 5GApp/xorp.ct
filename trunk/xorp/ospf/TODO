1) None of the packet decode routines check the type field in the header
against their own type field. Could probably put the approriate check
in the standard header decode code.

2) I don't think that the LSA routines check their own type field either.

3) The Network Mask field in OSPFv2 hello packets currently we seem to
be setting an index not a mask, check the spec to see what we should
be doing.

4) The LsaDecoder should have a method that can be used to check of LS
types are valid. This method should be used by data_description_received.

5) Are external-LSAs allowed in NSSAs?

Possible issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1) Received hello packets are demultiplex on the source address of the
packet or on the router ID, depending on the linktype that the packet
arrived on. If a packet is being demultipled on the source address and
the router ID changes is this likely to be a problem?
