		XORP RELEASE NOTES

This file contains XORP release notes (most recent releases first).

Release 1.3 (2006/??/??)
=========================
  ALL:
    - Numerous improvements, bug fixes and cleanup.

    - XORP now builds on Linux Fedora Core5, DragonFlyBSD-1.4,
      FreeBSD-6.1.

    - Implementation of IGMPv3 (RFC 3376) and MLDv2 (RFC 3810).
      Those are necessary to complete the Source-Specific Multicast
      support.

  CONFIGURATION:
    - Addition of new OSPF configuration statement as part of the MD5
      keys:

      * max-time-drift: u32 (default to 3600, i.e., 1 hour)

      It is used to set the maximum time drift (in seconds) among all
      OSPF routers. The allowed values are in the range [0--65535]. If
      the value is 65535, the time drift is unlimited.

    - The following statements for configuring static routes have been
      deprecated:
      route4, route6, interface-route4, interface-route6, mrib-route4,
      mrib-route6, mrib-interface-route4, mrib-interface-route6.

      The new replacement statements are:
      route, interface-route, mrib-route, mrib-interface-route.

      Each of the new statements can be used to configure either IPv4Net
      or IPv6Net route.

    - If a "then" policy block contains "accept" or "reject" statement,
      now all statements inside the "then" block are evaluated
      regardless of their position.

    - Addition of a new "exit" operational mode command that is
      equivalent to the "quit" operational mode command.

    - The "create" and "set" configuration commands are merged, so now
      the new "set" command can be used for setting values and for
      creating new configuration nodes. For backward compatibility,
      the obsoleted "create" command is preserved as an alias for the
      new "set" command, though it may be removed in the future.

  LIBXORP:
    - Few bug fixes in the RefTrie implementation.

  LIBXIPC:
    - Minor improvement in parsing XRL requests.

  LIBFEACLIENT:
    - 

  XRL:
    - 

  RTRMGR:
    - Various bug fixes.

  XORPSH:
    - Previously, the "commit" command was not available in
      configuration mode if there were no pending configuration changes.
      Now the "commit" command is always available, but the following
      message will be printed instead:
        "No configuration changes to commit."

    - Various bug fixes.

  POLICY:
    - Various bug fixes.

  FEA/MFEA:
    - Bug fix in transmitting large packets on Linux when using IP raw
      sockets.

      indefinitely between two XORP routers.

  OSPF:
    - Various bug fixes in the MD5 authentication support.

  BGP:
    - Prefix limits on a per peer basis.

  STATIC_ROUTES:
    - 

  MLD/IGMP:
    - Implementation of IGMPv3 (RFC 3376) and MLDv2 (RFC 3810).

    - Unification of the IGMP and MLD execution path.

  PIM-SM:
    - Bug fix related to the SPT switch (the bug is *BSD specific).

    - Use the RPF interface toward the BSR when transmitting a Cand-RP
      Advertisement message. Previously the first interface that is UP
      was chosen.

    - Use the RPF interface toward the RP when transmitting PIM Register
      messages toward the RP. Previously the interface of the directly
      connected source was chosen.

      the robustness variable count that allows tuning for the expected
      packet loss on a subnet.

    - Addition of support for user environmental variables CFLAGS_END and
      CXXFLAGS_END. Those variables can be used to specify the compiler
      flags (for the C and C++ compiler respectively) that must be after

      can be supplied for each allowed value or range.

    - Removal of the mechanism for specifying the hook for saving
      a configuration file (the "-s <app>" command-line argument).
      The mechanism is broken and is superseded by the rtrmgr template
      support for running external programs.

    - Various other improvements and bug fixes.

  XORPSH:
    - Addition of support to run xorpsh in non-interactive mode.

    - Modification of the configurational mode "show" command

      }
      OR
      authentication {
          type: "md5"
          password: "FOO"
      }

      reachable unicast address.

    - Resend some of the XRLs (e.g., those who do not carry soft-state
      such as protocol control messages) if there is an error.

    - Several bug fixes.

  FIB2MRIB:
    - This is a new module for propagating the unicast forwarding information
      obtained from the underlying system via the FEA to the multicast RIB.

      read the terminal size instead of using the default values.

    - A bug fix related to the CLI paging output: now it can handle properly
      lines that are longer than the width of the CLI output terminal.

    - Several other bug fixes.

      ServiceBase contains status information, (e.g. starting,
      running, shutting down, shutdown) and methods for triggering
      status changes (e.g.start, shutdown).  It also provides an
      interface for observers to be notified of state changes.

    - Addition of ctype(3) wrappers that work properly even if the
      value of the int argument is not representable as an unsigned
      char and doesn't have the value of EOF.

    - Fixes to XrlAtom binary marshalling methods and test code for
      checking this functionality in future.

  LIBFEACLIENT:
    - Added to project.  Provides interface configuration tree
      mirroring and update event notification.  Intended to unify how
      this data is replicated between processes.

  XRL:
    - kdoc generation nits.

  RTRMGR:
    - Fix the process name of a started proces to be the same
      as the binary name.

    - Minor code cleanup.

  XORPSH:
    - No significant changes.

  FEA/MFEA:
    - Added Linux Netlink support for writing network interface information,
      and routing entries to the kernel, and for observing the change of
      that information in the kernel.

    - Completed support for Linux /proc parsing to return network interface
      information.

    - Added support for NetBSD and OpenBSD to the unicast FEA.

    - Added compilation-time check whether the underlying system
      supports IPv6 multicast and IPv6 multicast routing, and isolate
      the compilation of all MFEA code that is specific to IPv6 multicast
      and IPv6 multicast routing.

    - Added support for run-time check whether the underlying system
      supports IPv4 or IPv6 multicast routing.

    - Various bug fixes and cleanup

  RIB:
    - No significant changes.

  BGP:
    - Supports multiprotocol IPv6.

    - The code for multicast SAFI is enabled but is untested.

    - A memory leak exists.

  MLD/IGMP:
    - No significant changes.

  PIM-SM:
    - A bug fix related to the removal of timed-out multicast forwarding
      entries.

  CLI:
    - Change slightly the command-line editing, so now Ctrl-W deletes
      the word before the cursor. Before, Ctrl-W would delete the
      whole line.

    - Apply a fix to libtecla in network mode such that
      keyboard-generated signals are not propagated to the process
      we have connected to.

  SNMP:
    - No significant changes.

  RIP:
    - Code added to talk to FEA and RIB.  To become functional it
      still requires the ability to send packets and receive UDP
      packets through the FEA (work in progress).

Release 0.4 (2003/08/28)
========================
  ALL:
    - Rename all process names from "foo" to "xorp_foo":
      bgp -> xorp_bgp
      fea -> xorp_fea
      fea_dummy -> xorp_fea_dummy
      finder -> xorp_finder
      ospfd -> xorp_ospf
      rib -> xorp_rib
      rtrmgr -> xorp_rtrmgr

    - Added support for "gmake install" that installs the required
      XORP pieces under /usr/local/xorp.
      Currently, the installed subdirectories and files follow
      the organization in the XORP source code tree.
      Only the following binaries are installed in subdirectory "bin":
      call_xrl, xorp_rtrmgr, xorpsh.

    - Removed old directory "mfea", because it is not needed anymore
      (all the MFEA code has been merged with the FEA).

    - The code does not compile anymore on MacOS X 10.2.x (or earlier),
      due to compiler issues. After Apple starts distributing a better
      compiler (probably with MacOS X 10.3.x?), then attempt will be
      made to keep the code compiling again on MacOS X.

  LIBXORP:
    - Added pre-order iterators for Trie and RefTrie.

  LIBXIPC:
    - Addition of virtual methods in XrlRouter to provide processes with
      an opportunity to detect finder connection, registration, and
      disconnection events.

  XRL:
    - Minor changes to clnt-gen that changes the names of some typedefs.

  RTRMGR:
    - Now all relative paths to templates, xrl files, configuration
      files, etc are computed relative to the root of the XORP tree.
      The root is computed in the following order:
      1. The shell environment XORP_ROOT (if exists).
      2. The parent directory the rtrmgr is run from
         (only if it contains the etc/templates and the xrl/targets
         directories).
      3. The XORP_ROOT value as defined in config.h (currently this is
         the installation directory, and it defaults to /usr/local/xorp).

  XORPSH:
    - Now all relative paths to executable commands are computed
      relative to the root of the XORP tree. The root is computed
      similar to the rtrmgr root (see above), except that in step (2)
      we consider the parent directory the xorpsh is run instead.

  FEA/MFEA:
    - Bug fix: if the multicast protocol to start/stop is PIM, then start/stop
      PIM multicast routing in the kernel.

    - Bug fix (Linux-specific): if IGMP/MLD is enabled, then the multicast
      router will properly receive all IGMP/MLD messages.

    - Added support to enable/disable unicast forwarding in the kernel
      via the FEA.
      Currently, the support is only for FreeBSD, but is not used yet.
      Hence, the user must explicitly enable unicast forwarding
      before starting XORP.
      E.g., in case of FreeBSD run `sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding=1`
      as root. In case of Linux run
      `echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward` as root.

    - Fix a compilation problem for NetBSD
      (courtesy Hitoshi Asaeda <Hitoshi.Asaeda@sophia.inria.fr>
      and Jun-ichiro itojun Hagino <itojun@iijlab.net>).

    - Initial support for Linux /proc parsing to return network interface
      information (work in progress).

    - Bug fixes in setting the broadcast or p2p flags and addresses
      in the FEA internal interface tree (IfTree).

    - Bug fix in computing the minimum size of a message received
      on a routing socket.

    - Change the MFEA configuration scripts so now the IPv4/IPv6 setup
      is controlled by a single variable IP_VERSION that should be
      either IPV4 or IPV6. Note that those configuration scripts
      are temporary solution until the MFEA is integrated with
      the rtrmgr.

  RIB:
    - No significant changes.

  BGP:
    - Update packets with unknown path attributes are now correctly handled.

  MLD/IGMP:
    - Change the "RX" log messages to include the vif name a message was
      received on.

    - Initial support for returning the process status via get_status XRL.

    - Change the MLD/IGMP configuration scripts so now the IPv4/IPv6 setup
      is controlled by a single variable IP_VERSION that should be
      either IPV4 or IPV6. Note that those configuration scripts
      are temporary solution until the MLD/IGMP is integrated with
      the rtrmgr.

  PIM-SM:
    - Change the "RX" log messages to include the vif name a message was
      received on.

    - Change the PIM configuration scripts so now the IPv4/IPv6 setup
      is controlled by a single variable IP_VERSION that should be
      either IPV4 or IPV6. Note that those configuration scripts
      are temporary solution until the PIM is integrated with
      the rtrmgr.

    - Implement Join/Prune items fragmentation across Join/Prune messages
      when generating Join/Prune messages.

    - Fix some of the XRL names related to static RP configuration
      in the configuration shell scripts.

    - Fix the generation of Assert messages when data packets are received
      on the wrong interface; in addition, the Assert messages triggered
      by data packets are rate-limited to one Assert message/s (on
      average, per (S,G) or (*,G) routing entry).

    - Implement an optimization when generating Assert messages
      triggered by the data packets received on the wrong interface:
      suppress the second Assert message that is a duplicate.

    - Implement bandwidth-prorated SPT switch triggering:
      The SPT switch can be triggered at the last-hop router if the
      bandwidth from a given source is above a configured threshold.
      In addition, the same mechanism is implemented in the RP as well
      (not in the spec, where the SPT switch in the RP is always triggered
      by the first packet).

    - Keep various PIM-related statistics (e.g., number of sent
      or received PIM control messages per interface, etc), and add
      the appropriate XRL interface to get or reset those statistics.

    - Modify slightly the "show pim join" CLI output. E.g., print
      "Could assert WC:" for all entries, print "Could assert SG:"
      for (S,G,rpt) as well, etc.

    - Bug fix: when receiving IPv6 PIM packets, use the IPv6-specific
      pseudo-header to compute the checksum.

  CLI:
    - On exit, restore the original terminal flags in case of stdio-based
      CLI access. This should fix a bug when running xorpsh from sh/bash
      and pressing Ctrl-D leaves sh/bash in non-echo mode.

    - Reverse the key binding of 'j' and 'k' in page mode. Now the
      binding is same as in "vi/more/less":
      'j' scroll down one line, while 'k' scroll up one line.

  SNMP:
    - Full implementation of BGP4-MIB module (RFC 1657) including traps.

  RIP:
    - Implementation functionally operational save communication with the RIB
      for injecting routes, the FEA to send and receive packets, FEA
      interface monitoring code, and an XRL interface for configuration.

Release 0.3 (2003/06/09)
========================
  ALL:
    - Compilation fixes for GCC3.3 on FreeBSD 4.8R.

    - Cross directory build and gmake check support.

    - Purge of abort() calls.  Replacement by XLOG_UNFINISHED,
      XLOG_UNREACHABLE and XLOG_ASSERT as appropriate, or in some
      cases better error handling code.

    - Change to autoconf-2.53 and automake-1.5 as standard autotool versions.
      The older autoconf-2.13 and automake-1.4 should still work.

    - Remove the multicast-specific timer implementation, and
      use instead the default Xorp timers (XorpTimer).

  LIBXORP:
    - Allocation without construction bug fixed in SelectorList code.  Fixes
      potential for junk values and sanity checking when the number of active
      file descriptors is large.

    - Addition of status codes for XORP processes to report operational
      state (to the rtrmgr).

    - Addition of XLOG_UNFINISHED and XLOG_UNREACHABLE to xlog.h.

    - Explicitly disable copy constructor and assignment operator for
      EventLoop.

    - Replacement of traditional struct timeval with TimeVal class.  TimeVal
      comes with constructors and numerous helper methods.

    - IPvXNet methods renaming:
      get_ipv4Net() -> get_ipv4net()
      get_ipv6Net() -> get_ipv6net()

  LIBXIPC:
    - Removal of 0.1 release Finder code and compatibility shims that allowed
      newer and older code to co-exist.  Renaming of "FinderNG" classes
      and files to "Finder".

    - Use of class and instance names and Finder policy for having a
      primary instance in a class (first registered is primary, then second
      in case first exits/fails, and so forth).

    - Support for tunneling XRLs and XRL responses to and from the Finder.

    - Implementation event notification through the Finder using tunneled
      XRLs.  XRL Targets can now request to be notified of the birth and
      death of other XRL Targets by the Finder.

    - Reduced number of XrlErrors to hopefully simplify handling errors.

    - Addition of new enumated type XrlErrorCode and change
      XrlError::error_code method to return this type.  Allows compiler to
      detect unhandled error types in switch statements (if default case is
      not used).

    - Finder clients no longer reconnect to the Finder should they lose their
      connection per ${XORP}/docs/design_arch/error_handling.tex.

    - Increased Finder timeout for call_xrl.

    - Fix memory corruption following Finder transport error events.

    - Convert all code to use FinderServer class when they need to instantiate
      a Finder.

    - More consistent handling of defaults on send and receive sides of Finder.

    - Fix xrl_parser_input.cc handling of absolute file names.

    - Assorted minor clean-ups.

  XRL:
    - Addition of get_status and shutdown methods to the common interface.

  RTRMGR:
    - Workaround for yacc incompatibilities on newer Redhat releases.

    - Implement a new TaskManager, which handles actually doing the
      work during a commit, starting processes and validating that they
      start, dependency interlocking between processes, and shutting
      down processes that are no longer needed.

    - rtrmgr will now shutdown processes after they are not needed.

    - rtrmgr can now use the common XRL call get_status to monitor
      process state, and the common XRL shutdown to gracefully shutdown a
      process.  Added new modinfo subcommands to specify when to use
      XRLs for these tasks.

    - Use system MD5 for authentication.

    - Better config file string parser.

    - Add tinderbox tests to cover some of the basic functionality.

    - Better error handling (more compliant with XORP Error Handling
      document).

  XORPSH:
    - Ctrl-C now terminates the current command,  Ctrl-D exits xorpsh.

  FEA:
    - MFEA code merged with the unicast FEA, though logically the MFEA
      is still a separate entity.

    - Refactoring of FEA internals regarding reading/writing/observing
      interfaces-related information and forwarding-table related
      information.

    - Support for few more OS-specific methods for reading
      interface-related information or forwarding table related information.

    - Addition of IPv6 support (where missing) for reading/writing information
      regarding network interfaces or the unicast forwarding table.

    - Addition of a command-line option to ``fea'' and ``fea_dummy'' to
      specify the finder hostname and port number.

    - On startup and shutdown remove from the kernel all forwarding entries
      added by the fea.

    - Addition of XRLs to obtain information about all network interfaces
      (i.e., not only those that are configured by the rtrmgr).
      Should be used only for debugging purpose (though temporary they
      are used by the MFEA as well).

    - ``fea_rtsock'' deprecated (replaced with the generic ``fea'').

  RIB:
    - Export a RIB table to any target that registers interest.

    - Replace fea_fti/0.1 XRL interface with fti/0.2.  The new interface
      introduces metric, admin_distance and protocol_origin when RIB
      information is propagated to the RIB clients.

    - Refactoring of the Vif manager implementation.

    - Support for returning the process status through the get_status
      XRL and shutting down using the shutdown XRL.

  BGP:
    - More robust to XRL communication failures. In particular support
      for retransmission.

    - Replace calls to abort() with more self-explanatory self-destruction.

    - Terminate interface removed and replaced with common shutdown XRL
      interface.

    - Use system md5 header files.

    - Peer list sorted by remote IP for snmp.

    - Uninitialised variable bug fix in NextHopRibRequest.

    - Initial support for returning the process status via get_status XRL.

  MFEA:
    - MFEA code merged with the unicast FEA, though logically the MFEA
      is still a separate entity.
      As part of the merging process, the MFEA now obtains the information
      about network interfaces and the unicast forwarding table from the
      FEA instead of the the kernel.

    - Addition of a check for Router Alert IP option.

    - Enable receiving of hop-by-hop options.

    - Replace all MLD6_XXX with MLD_XXX (following KAME's recommendation).

    - Compilation fixes for NetBSD-current (and probably NetBSD-1.6.1)
      (courtesy Hitoshi Asaeda <Hitoshi.Asaeda@sophia.inria.fr>).

    - Initial support for returning the process status via get_status XRL.

    - Addition of a command-line option to ``test_mfea'' to specify the
      finder hostname and port number.

    - Misc. bug fixes, internal code refactoring, and cleanup.

  MLD/IGMP:
    - Protocol implementation testing completed.

    - Replace all MLD6_XXX with MLD_XXX (following KAME's recommendation).

    - Unify some of the MLD and IGMP protocol-specific code.

    - Support for configurable setting of the protocol version per vif.

    - Addition of a command-line option to ``test_mld6igmp'' to specify the
      finder hostname and port number.

    - Misc. bug fixes.

  PIM-SM:
    - Configuration-related fixes.

    - Rename RP-related configuration commands and XRLs:
      OLD: add_config_rp{4,6}, delete_config_rp{4,6}, config_rp_done
      NEW: add_config_static_rp{4,6}, delete_config_static_rp{4,6},
           config_static_rp_done

    - Addition of XRL interface to receive MRIB-related updates
      from the RIB; the interface is not used yet.

    - Initial support for returning the process status via get_status XRL.

    - Addition of a mechanism that should hold-off PIM-SM status
      to PROC_NOT_READY until it has received all necessary confirmation
      from both MFEA and MLD/IGMP.

    - Addition of PIM configuration option and XRL interface to configure
      the SPT-switch bandwidth threshold.  Currently, the SPT-switch is
      enabled only for the corner cases: switch on the first packet, or
      never switch.

    - Addition of a command-line option to ``test_pim'' to specify the
      finder hostname and port number.

  CLI:
    - Critical bug fix (could be triggered if a program like
      ${XORP}/pim/test_pim is run in background, and is accessed
      by the built-in CLI).

    - Addition of Ctrl-C handling:
      o If Ctrl-C is hit before <Enter>, then cancel the current line
        and present a new prompt.
      o If Ctrl-C is hit while waiting for command completion, then
        cancel the wait and present a new prompt.

    - Removed the 5 seconds timer that would timeout the waiting for
      command completion (the user can use Ctrl-C to cancel the wait).

    - Enable receiving Ctrl-C if the input is stdio (e.g., in case of xorpsh).

  SNMP:
    - Integrated with Net-SNMP agent.

    - Implemented bgpVersion and bgpPeerTable from BGP4-MIB (RFC 1657).

  RIP:
    - Implementation started.

Release 0.2 (2003/03/10)
========================

  ALL:
    - Source code compiles under GCC 3.2.1 and on Mac OS X 10.2.x (GCC 3.1)
      in addition to GCC 2.95.x and 2.96.

  LIBXORP:
    - Add libxorp/ref_trie.hh :
      Implementation of a trie to support route
      lookups.  Based on trie.hh, but with reference-counted storage
      supporting delayed deletion.

  LIBXIPC:
    - Complete re-implementation of the XRL finder, so that
      registration/deregistration to the finder uses XRLs.

  RTRMGR:
    - Add operational-mode commands for monitoring BGP routes and
      peers, and VIF/interface state.

    - Re-implement how rtrmgr decides when to start processes.  This
      fixes a few bugs in the dependency tracking - prior to this the
      RIB would not be started because it requires no direct configuration.

  FEA:
    - Bug fixes.

  RIB:
    - Ensure that the originating protocol is propagated throughout
      the RIB.

    - Fix bug where routes for directly connected interfaces were
      incorrectly being fed back to the FEA (which didn't expect to
      see add_route for these subnets).

  BGP:
    - XRL interfaces for monitoring BGP peers and the complete BGP
      routing table added.  Helper programs bgp/tools/show_routes and
      bgp/tools/show_peers added, along with versions of these for
      running from xorpsh.

    - Support for adding/removing MEDs added.

    - BGP message handling and Path Attribute handling re-written to
      be much cleaner and more efficient.

    - Re-structured the BGP peer state machine to make the code easier
      to understand.

    - Change BGP to use reference-counted tries.  This greatly
      simplifies the implementation of background tasks.

    - Correctly handle unrecognized optional transitive attributes.

    - Merge isolation tests into a single binary.

    - Added BGP/RIB/FEA integration tests.

    - Too many bug fixes to list.

  MFEA:
    - Minor bug fixes.

  MLD/IGMP:
    - No changes.

  PIM-SM:
    - PIM-SM Bootstrap mechanism reimplemented and tested.
      Note that the Bootstrap-related configuration commands in
      pim/configure_pim have changed slightly.

    - Detailed testing of the basic protocol and the Bootstrap mechanism
      completed and documented in the XORP PIM-SM Test Suite document.

    - Numerous bug fixes.


Release 0.1 (2002/12/11)
========================

  - First public release.

  - CVS repository opened to the world.
