		XORP RELEASE NOTES

This file contains XORP release notes (most recent releases first).

Release 0.3 (2003/??/??)
========================
  ALL:
    - 

  LIBXORP:
    - 

  LIBXIPC:
    - 

  RTRMGR:
    - 

  FEA:
    - 

  RIB: 
    - 

  BGP:
    - 

  MFEA:
    - IPv6-related bug fixes.

  MLD/IGMP:
    - 

  PIM-SM:
    - 

  CLI:
    - Critical bug fix (could be triggered if a program like
      xorp/pim/test_pim is run in background, and is accessed
      by the built-in CLI).


Release 0.2 (2003/03/10)
========================

  ALL:
    - Source code compiles under GCC 3.2.1 and on Mac OS X 10.2.x (GCC 3.1)
      in addition to GCC 2.95.x and 2.96.

  LIBXORP:
    - Add libxorp/ref_trie.hh :
      Implementation of a trie to support route
      lookups.  Based on trie.hh, but with reference-counted storage
      supporting delayed deletion.

  LIBXIPC:
    - Complete re-implementation of the XRL finder, so that
      registration/deregistration to the finder uses XRLs.

  RTRMGR:
    - Add operational-mode commands for monitoring BGP routes and
      peers, and VIF/interface state.
 
    - Re-implement how rtrmgr decides when to start processes.  This
      fixes a fex bugs in the dependency tracking - prior to this the
      RIB would not be started because it requires no direct configuration.

  FEA:
    - Bug fixes.

  RIB: 
    - Ensure that the originating protocol is propagated throughout
      the RIB.

    - Fix bug where routes for directly connected interfaces were
      incorrectly being fed back to the FEA (which didn't expect to
      see add_route for these subnets).

  BGP:
    - XRL interfaces for monitoring BGP peers and the complete BGP
      routing table added.  Helper programs bgp/tools/show_routes and
      bgp/tools/show_peers added, along with versions of these for
      running from xorpsh.

    - Support for adding/removing MEDs added.

    - BGP message handling and Path Attribute handling re-written to
      be much cleaner and more efficient.

    - Re-structured the BGP peer state machine to make the code easier
      to understand.

    - Change BGP to use reference-counted tries.  This greatly
      simplies the implementation of background tasks.

    - Correctly handle unrecognized optional transitive attributes.

    - Merge isolation tests into a single binary.

    - Added BGP/RIB/FEA integration tests.

    - Too many bug fixes to list.

  MFEA:
    - Minor bug fixes.

  MLD/IGMP:
    - No changes.

  PIM-SM:
    - PIM-SM Bootstrap mechanism reimplemented and tested.
      Note that the Bootstrap-related configuration commands in
      pim/configure_pim have changed slightly.

    - Detailed testing of the basic protocol and the Bootstrap mechanism
      completed and documented in the XORP PIM-SM Test Suite document.

    - Numerious bug fixes.


Release 0.1 (2002/12/11)
========================

  - First public release.

  - CVS repository opened to the world.
