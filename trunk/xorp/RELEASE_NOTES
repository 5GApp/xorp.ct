		XORP RELEASE NOTES

This file contains XORP release notes (most recent releases first).

Release 0.3 (2003/06/06)
========================
  ALL:
    - Compilation fixes for GCC3.3 on FreeBSD 4.8R.

    - Cross directory build and gmake check support.

    - Purge of abort() calls.  Replacement by XLOG_UNFINISHED and
      XLOG_UNREACHABLE.

    - Change to autoconf-2.53 and automake-1.5 as standard autotool versions.
      The older autoconf-2.13 and automake-1.4 should still work.

    - Remove the multicast-specific timer implementation, and
      use instead the default Xorp timers (XorpTimer).

  LIBXORP:
    - Allocation without construction bug fixed in SelectorList code.  Fixes
      potential for junk values and sanity checking when the number of active
      file descriptors is large.

    - Addition of status codes for XORP processes to report operational 
      state (to the rtrmgr).

    - Addition of XLOG_UNFINISHED and XLOG_UNREACHABLE to xlog.h.

    - Explicitly disable copy constructor and assignment operator for
      EventLoop.

    - Replacement of traditional struct timeval with TimeVal class.  TimeVal
      comes with constructors and numerous helper methods.

    - IPvXNet methods renaming:
      get_ipv4Net() -> get_ipv4net()
      get_ipv6Net() -> get_ipv6net()

  LIBXIPC:
    - Removal of 0.1 release Finder code and compatability shims that allowed
      newer and older code to co-exist.  Renaming of "FinderNG" classes
      and files to "Finder".

    - Use of class and instance names and Finder policy for having a
      primary instance in a class (first registered is primary, then second
      in case first exits/fails, and so forth).

    - Support for tunneling XRLs and XRL responses to and from the Finder. 

    - Implementation event notification through the Finder using tunneled 
      XRLs.  XRL Targets can now request to be notified of the birth and
      death of other XRL Targets by the Finder.

    - Reduced number of XrlErrors to hopefully simplify handling errors.  

    - Addition of new enumated type XrlErrorCode and change 
      XrlError::error_code method to return this type.  Allows compiler to
      detect unhandled error types in switch statements (if default case is
      not used).

    - Finder clients no longer reconnect to the Finder should they lose their
      connection per ${XORP}/docs/design_arch/error_handling.tex.

    - Increased Finder timeout for call_xrl.

    - Fix memory corruption following Finder transport error events.

    - Convert all code to use FinderServer class when they need to instantiate
      a Finder.

    - More consistent handling of defaults on send and receive sides of Finder.

    - Fix xrl_parser_input.cc handling of absolute file names.

    - Assorted minor clean-ups.

  XRL:
    - Addition of get_status and shutdown methods to the common interface.

  RTRMGR:
    - 

  XORPSH:
    - 

  FEA:
    - MFEA code merged with the unicast FEA, though logically the MFEA
      is still a separate entity.

    - Refactoring of FEA internals regarding reading/writing/observing
      interfaces-related information and forwarding-table related
      information.

    - Support for few more OS-specific methods for reading
      interface-related information or forwarding table related information.

    - Addition of IPv6 support (where missing) for reading/writing information
      regarding network interfaces or the unicast forwarding table.

    - Addition of a command-line option to ``fea'' and ``fea_dummy'' to
      specify the finder hostname and port number.

    - On startup and shutdown remove from the kernel all forwarding entries
      added by the fea.

    - Addition of XRLs to obtain information about all network interfaces
      (i.e., not only those that are configured by the rtrmgr).
      Should be used only for debugging purpose (though temporary they
      are used by the MFEA as well).

    - ``fea_rtsock'' deprecated (replaced with the generic ``fea'').

  RIB: 
    - Export a RIB table to any target that registers interest.

    - Replace fea_fti/0.1 XRL interface with fti/0.2.  The new interface
      introduces metric, admin_distance and protocol_origin when RIB
      information is propagated to the RIB clients.

    - Refactoring of the Vif manager implementation.

    - Support for setting the process status PROC_FOO code.

  BGP:
    - More robust to XRL communication failures. In particular support
      for retransmission.

    - Replace calls to abort() with more self-explanatory self-destruction.

    - Terminate interface removed and replaced with common shutdown interface.

    - Use system md5 header files.

    - Peer list sorted by remote IP for snmp.

    - Uninitialised variable bug fix in NextHopRibRequest.

  MFEA:
    - MFEA code merged with the unicast FEA, though logically the MFEA
      is still a separate entity.
      As part of the merging process, the MFEA now obtains the information
      about network interfaces and the unicast forwarding table from the
      FEA instead of the the kernel.

    - Addition of a check for Router Alert IP option.

    - Enable receiving of hop-by-hop options.

    - Replace all MLD6_XXX with MLD_XXX (following KAME's recommendation).

    - Compilation fixes for NetBSD-current (and probably NetBSD-1.6.1)
      (courtesy Hitoshi Asaeda <Hitoshi.Asaeda@sophia.inria.fr>).

    - Initial support for setting the process status PROC_FOO code.

    - Addition of a command-line option to ``test_mfea'' to specify the
      finder hostname and port number.

    - Misc. bug fixes, internal code refactoring, and cleanup.

  MLD/IGMP:
    - Protocol implementation testing completed.

    - Replace all MLD6_XXX with MLD_XXX (following KAME's recommendation).

    - Unify some of the MLD and IGMP protocol-specific code.

    - Support for configurable setting of the protocol version per vif.

    - Addition of a command-line option to ``test_mld6igmp'' to specify the
      finder hostname and port number.

    - Misc. bug fixes.

  PIM-SM:
    - Configuration-related fixes.

    - Rename RP-related configuration commands and XRLs:
      OLD: add_config_rp{4,6}, delete_config_rp{4,6}, config_rp_done
      NEW: add_config_static_rp{4,6}, delete_config_static_rp{4,6},
           config_static_rp_done

    - Addition of XRL interface to receive MRIB-related updates
      from the RIB; the interface is not used yet.

    - Initial support for setting the process status PROC_FOO code.

    - Addition of a mechanism that should hold-off PIM-SM status
      to PROC_NOT_READY until it has received all necessary confirmation
      from both MFEA and MLD/IGMP.

    - Addition of PIM configuration option and XRL interface to configure
      the SPT-switch bandwidth threshold.  Currently, the SPT-switch is
      enabled only for the corner cases: switch on the first packet, or
      never switch.

    - Addition of a command-line option to ``test_pim'' to specify the
      finder hostname and port number.

  CLI:
    - Critical bug fix (could be triggered if a program like
      ${XORP}/pim/test_pim is run in background, and is accessed
      by the built-in CLI).

    - Addition of Ctrl-C handling:
      o If Ctrl-C is hit before <Enter>, then cancel the current line
        and present a new prompt.
      o If Ctrl-C is hit while waiting for command completion, then
        cancel the wait and present a new prompt.

    - Removed the 5 seconds timer that would timeout the waiting for
      command completion (the user can use Ctrl-C to cancel the wait).

    - Enable receiving Ctrl-C if the input is stdio (e.g., in case of xorpsh).

  SNMP:
    - Integrated with Net-SNMP agent.
    - Implemented bgpVersion and bgpPeerTable from BGP4-MIB (RFC 1657).

  RIP:
    - Implementation started.

Release 0.2 (2003/03/10)
========================

  ALL:
    - Source code compiles under GCC 3.2.1 and on Mac OS X 10.2.x (GCC 3.1)
      in addition to GCC 2.95.x and 2.96.

  LIBXORP:
    - Add libxorp/ref_trie.hh :
      Implementation of a trie to support route
      lookups.  Based on trie.hh, but with reference-counted storage
      supporting delayed deletion.

  LIBXIPC:
    - Complete re-implementation of the XRL finder, so that
      registration/deregistration to the finder uses XRLs.

  RTRMGR:
    - Add operational-mode commands for monitoring BGP routes and
      peers, and VIF/interface state.
 
    - Re-implement how rtrmgr decides when to start processes.  This
      fixes a fex bugs in the dependency tracking - prior to this the
      RIB would not be started because it requires no direct configuration.

  FEA:
    - Bug fixes.

  RIB: 
    - Ensure that the originating protocol is propagated throughout
      the RIB.

    - Fix bug where routes for directly connected interfaces were
      incorrectly being fed back to the FEA (which didn't expect to
      see add_route for these subnets).

  BGP:
    - XRL interfaces for monitoring BGP peers and the complete BGP
      routing table added.  Helper programs bgp/tools/show_routes and
      bgp/tools/show_peers added, along with versions of these for
      running from xorpsh.

    - Support for adding/removing MEDs added.

    - BGP message handling and Path Attribute handling re-written to
      be much cleaner and more efficient.

    - Re-structured the BGP peer state machine to make the code easier
      to understand.

    - Change BGP to use reference-counted tries.  This greatly
      simplies the implementation of background tasks.

    - Correctly handle unrecognized optional transitive attributes.

    - Merge isolation tests into a single binary.

    - Added BGP/RIB/FEA integration tests.

    - Too many bug fixes to list.

  MFEA:
    - Minor bug fixes.

  MLD/IGMP:
    - No changes.

  PIM-SM:
    - PIM-SM Bootstrap mechanism reimplemented and tested.
      Note that the Bootstrap-related configuration commands in
      pim/configure_pim have changed slightly.

    - Detailed testing of the basic protocol and the Bootstrap mechanism
      completed and documented in the XORP PIM-SM Test Suite document.

    - Numerious bug fixes.
