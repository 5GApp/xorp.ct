* ether_compat.c is not linked against the library. Remove it
  along with ether_compat.h??
  If not, add to it the XORP copyright header (if that file was
  written by us).

* Change Vif::vif_index() type from uint16_t to size_t ??

* Merge test_ipnet with test_ipv{4,6,x}net (or remove it if
  the new test programs cover all tests in test_ipnet).

* Remove/disable IPvX::copy_out(struct sockaddr_in&) for IPv6 addresses.
  Similarly, remove/disable IPvX::copy_out(struct sockaddr_in6&) for IPv4
  addresses. Do the same thing for the corresponding copy_in(). (OK???)

* Rename ConfigParam::_initial_value and get_initial_value() to
  default_value

* Rename Trie to SomethingMoreAppropriate(TM) and rename Trie::route()
  to SomethingMoreAppropriate::payload()

* Rename Transaction to SomethingBatchLike(TM)

* Rename IPvX *Vif::addr_ptr() to IPvX& Vif::vif_addr() instead?

* All constants such as IP address size, should be static class constants.

* Need to do something about multiple EventLoop instances (breaks xorp
  ipc).  Some alternatives:
	- we have an event loop instance count that stops multiple
          instances.
	- EventLoop::run() becomes a static member that runs all the 
	  event loops.
	- change the way ipc learns about the event loop.

* Do kdoc-ify ref_trie.hh and trie.hh
