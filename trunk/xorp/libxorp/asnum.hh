/**
 * @short A class for storing an AS number used by protocols such as BGP
 * 
 * This class can be used to store an AS number that can be either
 * 16 or 32 bits.  Originally, the AS numbers were defined as 16-bit
 * unsigned numbers.  Later the "extended" AS numbers were introduced,
 * which are unsigned 32-bit numbers.
 *
 * 16-bit numbers are expanded to 32-bit by extending them with 0's in front.
 * 32-bit numbers are represented in a 16-bit path, by a special 16-bit value,
 * AS_TRAN, which will be allocated by IANA.
 * Together with any AsPath containing AS_TRAN, we will always see a NEW_AS_PATH
 * attribute which contains the full 32-bit representation of the path.
 * So there is no loss of information.
 *
 * The internal representation of an AsNum is 32-bit in host order.
 *
 * An AsNum must always be initialized, so the default constructor
 * is never called.
