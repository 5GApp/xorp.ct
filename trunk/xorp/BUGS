Situation: entering a new BGP config in xorpsh.
           "edit protocols bgp"
           "peer {"    
Result: creates a peer with the peer host called "{".  This is incorrect 
        syntax and should really be rejected.

Situation: almost anywhere in xorpsh, type "help <something>" where
     something is the command you'd like help with.  Eg "help save" in

Result: "syntax error, expecting."

Submitted by: mjh
Situation: running xorp (off Adam's live CD), with BGP up and running.
           Type to xorpsh in config mode:
             "delete protocols bgp"
             "commit"
Result: command hangs, requiring ^C to interrupt the command.  After ^C, 
        rtrmgr has exited (probably crashed).
