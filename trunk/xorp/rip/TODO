o Play catch up with RIPng.  This is mostly dulicating socket handling
  code.

o Arrange to have triggered updates go out of all RIP Port instances
  at the same time.  This is a little tricky as each RIP Port instance
  is autonomous.

o Clean up RIB interaction.  Add flag signifying RIB aware of route
  state to RouteEntry structure.  Twiddle flag when route is updated.

o Consider keeping losing routes, age them in the normal way, etc, and
  be prepared to fall back to them if/when winning routes expire.
