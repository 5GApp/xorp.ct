o Validate origin address in Port<A>::port_io_receive If packet does
  not come from a host on the same network or from the end of a point
  to point link it should not be processed.

o Re-jig socket code.  1 socket to receive multicast on.  One socket
  per interface to send mcast on, one socket per interface to receive
  unicast on.

o Add HopCount check on received RIPng packets.

o Check and double check nexthop handling paying attention to incoming
  and outgoing interfaces and their properties.

o Reception of static routes from FEA / statics process.

o Advertising of interface addresses.

o Handle interfaces coming up and down and socket errors.

o Inter-op testing.

// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Post 1.0 Release

o MIB.

o Clean up RIB interaction.  Add flag signifying RIB aware of route
  state to RouteEntry structure.  Twiddle flag when route is updated.

o Consider keeping losing routes, age them in the normal way, etc, and
  be prepared to fall back to them if/when winning routes expire.

o Arrange to have triggered updates go out of all RIP Port instances
  at the same time.  This is a little tricky as each RIP Port instance
  is autonomous.

o Add horizon checks to tools/rip_announcer.cc and
  tools/ripng_announcer.cc for packets they receive.  This is icing on
  the cake.
