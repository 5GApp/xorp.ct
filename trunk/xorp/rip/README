This directory contains RIP implementations that are used by the XORP
project.  XORP uses a modified versions of routed and route6d.

Top level files for RIP are: 

route6d/			RIPng routing daemon with XORP modifications.

route6d-20011126-101012.tar.gz	Snapshot of FreeBSD's route6d taken from 
			        FreeBSD's CVS archive on 2001/11/26.

routed/				RIP v1 and v2 routing daemon with XORP 
				modifications.

routed-20011126-095745.tar.gz	Snapshot of FreeBSD's routed taken from 
			        FreeBSD's CVS archive on 2001/11/26.

At the time of writing the XORP modifications to routed and route6d
still have to be completed.
