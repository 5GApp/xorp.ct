How to configure your Net-SNMP agent to run with XORP
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

- You need Net-SNMP version 5.0.6 or greater
- You must make libnetsnmpxorp.so accessible to your runtime loader.  Depending
  on your system, that requires one of the following:  
	* Copying libnetsnmpxorp.so to your library directory (typically
	  /usr/local/lib)
		    OR
	* Setting a linker environment variable (typically LD_LIBRARY_PATH) to
	  point to the directory where the library is.

- To avoid opening security holes, we recommend allowing only SNMPv3
  authenticated requests.  If you want to create a secure user, execute the 
  command net-snmp-config --create-snmpv3-user.  These are the settings that
  match the provided snmp.conf file (see next section):

    user           pass-phrase         sec level
    --------------------------------------------
    privuser      I am priv user       auth+priv
 
  You must create at least one user if you want to be able to access the SNMP 
  agent.
 
- snmpd can only respond to Xrls after xorp_if_mib_module has been loaded.
  Adding the following line to the file snmpd.conf (by default located in 
  /usr/local/share/snmp) will preload this module when snmpd is started.  

  dlmod xorp_if_mib_module <absolute path full filename>

  for instance...

  dlmod xorp_if_mib_module /home/panther/u0/jcardona/mibs/xorp_if_mib_module.so


To run the client-side scripts in this directory 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

- The scripts in this directory use the client-side Net-SNMP tools to
  communicate with the agent.  They rely on file snmp.conf to provide valid 
  default values for the SNMP version to use, the user, community and 
  security level.  If your agent was configured with the default security user
  suggested in the previous section, you should copy the snmp.conf found in this
  directory to ~/.snmp/snmp.conf.  Otherwise you'll have to create your own
  snmp.conf so it matches your settings.  
  

- You must make XORP textual mib files (xorp/mibs/textual/*.txt) accessible to
  the Net-SNMP command line tools.  Either set the MIBDIRS (man snmpcmd(1)) 
  environment variable to point to that directory or copy those files to your
  mibs directory (default is /usr/local/share/snmp/mibs).  For instance:

  export MIBDIRS=+/home/jsmith/xorp/mibs/textual
