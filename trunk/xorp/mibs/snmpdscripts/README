How to configure your Net-SNMP agent to run with XORP
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

- You need Net-SNMP version 5.0.6 or greater
- You must make libnetsnmpxorp.so accessible to your runtime loader.  Depending 
  on your system, that requires one of the following:  
	* Copying libnetsnmpxorp.so to your library directory (typically
	  /usr/local/lib)
		    OR
	* Setting a linker environment variable (typically LD_LIBRARY_PATH) to
	  point to the directory where the library is.

To run the scripts in this directory
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

- These scripts rely on file snmp.conf to provide valid default values
  for the SNMP version to use, the user, community and security level.  This way
  the scripts do not need to be modified to be executed by different users.

  If you are using a clean Net-SNMP installation, just copy the provided
  snmp.conf to your home directory and create the following user (with the
  command net-snmp-config --create-snmpv3-user):

    user           pass-phrase         sec level
    --------------------------------------------
    privuser      I am priv user       auth+priv
 
  If you already have a running Net-SNMP installation, create a snmp.conf file
  (man snmp.conf(5)) in your home directory if you have not done that already.
  In that file you should define your user parameters.  Make sure that you
  define at least all the directives that you'll find in this directory's
  snmp.conf

Make snmpd responsive to Xrls
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

- snmpd can only respond to Xrls after xorp_if_mib_module has been loaded.
  Adding the following line to the file snmpd.conf (by default located in 
  /usr/local/share/snmp) will preload this module when snmpd is started.  

  dlmod xorp_if_mib_module <absolute path full filename>

  for instance...

  dlmod xorp_if_mib_module /home/panther/u0/jcardona/mibs/xorp_if_module.so
