How to configure your Net-SNMP agent to run with XORP
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

- You need Net-SNMP version 5.0.6 or greater
- You must make libnetsnmpxorp.so accessible to your runtime loader.  Depending 
  on your system, that requires one of the following:  
	* Copying libnetsnmpxorp.so to your library directory (typically
	  /usr/local/lib)
		    OR
	* Setting a linker environment variable (typically LD_LIBRARY_PATH) to
	  point to the directory where the library is.

To run the scripts in this directory

- These scripts rely on file snmp.conf to provide valid default values
  for the SNMP version to use, the user, community and security level.
  For that, you have two options, depending on wether you where using Net-SNMP
  or not:  

    * For new Net-SNMP users, just copy the provided snmp.conf to your home
      directory and create the following user (with the command net-snmp-config
      --create-snmpv3-user):

    user           pass-phrase         sec level
    --------------------------------------------
    privuser      I am priv user       auth+priv
 
    * If you already have Net-SNMP running, and you would like to run the scripts as
      an existing user, make sure the following variables are defined in your
      snmp.conf file: defVersion, defCommunity, defSecurityName, defPassphrase, 
                      defAuthType, defPrivType, defSecurityLevel 

- Finally, you must define the environment variable XORP to point to xorp's top
  source directory.
