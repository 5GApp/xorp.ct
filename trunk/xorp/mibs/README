MIB modules for Net-SNMP
========================

This directory contains MIB modules that can be dynamically loaded by the
Net-SNMP agent and that provide the MIBS that correspond to the protocols
implemented in XORP.

Configuration
=============

There are no executable files in this directory, just dynamically loadable
modules (shared objects).  These modules are designed for the SNMP agent 
included in the Net-SNMP package, version 5.0.6 or newer. 

Startup
=======

In normal operation, the SNMP agent would be started by the XORP router manager
process, not directly from the command line.  

For testing and debugging purposes, the SNMP agent can be manually started.  The
proper sequence is:

    - Start the finder + other protocol processes (currently only bgp supported)
    - Start /usr/local/sbin/snmpd
    - Load xorp_if_mib_module (you may use the scripts provided in snmpdscripts,
	or follow the instructions in snmpdscripts/README to have snmpd load
	it when it starts)
    - Load other protocol MIB modules (currently only bgp4_mib_1657.so)
	(for this you can use the same methods as the step before, or the Xrl
	methods you will find in xorp/xrl/interfaces/xorp_if_mib.xif)
       
Documentation
=============

The SNMP framework used in the project is described in:
	$(XORP)/docs/snmp


Testing
=======

Run gmake check in this directory.

Status
======

The MIB development framework is complete except for SNMP trap support.

Currenly we have partially implemented BGP4-MIB (RFC 1657), more specifically,
the scalar bgpVersion and the table bgpPeerTable.
 
Known problems
==============

Terminating snmpd (v 5.0.8) with XORP modules still loaded causes a core dump in FreeBSD.
