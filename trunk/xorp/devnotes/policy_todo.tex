\title{XORP Policy Tasks}
\date{June 18, 2008}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\section{Introduction}
This document lists tasks that need to be completed in order to bring XORP's
policy framework to a more mature state.  Both functional aspects, such as the
completeness of the framework compared to Juniper's and Cisco's, and non
functional aspects ({\em i.e.,} performance) are enumerated.  They are listed in
the following order / categories:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Route matching.  What are the criteria for identifying particular routes
in policies?

\item Route actions.  Once a route is matched, what actions and modifications
can be done on it?

\item Other policy aspects.  Miscellaneous functionality such as how policies
are attached to protocols and so on.

\item Performance.  What can be done to improve XORP's performance with regards
to policy?
\end{enumerate}

An attempt has been made to capture Juniper's functionality exhaustively.
Regarding Cisco, only a best effort has been made to map its functionality to
that of Juniper, and no real attempt has been made to verify whether Cisco
supports functionality that Juniper does not.  It probably is the case though
that all that can be done with Cisco can also be done with Juniper, and hence
using Juniper as a reference for XORP will most likely yield a satisfactory
policy implementation.

The indication of working days needed per task is very approximate.  Integral
numbers are used throughout and many one day tasks indeed can take less time,
especially when tasks are correlated or similar in nature.  If all tasks need to
be completed, the total day count is probably over-estimated by 50\%.  However,
individual tasks longer than a day have a more optimistic rather than
conservative estimate.  Once the necessary tasks for completion have been
selected, a feasibility study with a more accurate day count will follow.  Tasks
without a day count are already completed, and for those with question marks it
is uncertain what the requirement actually is and whether it is of interest for
XORP in the near future.

\hline

100 &
Aggregate contributor.  Match routes that are contributing to a configured
aggregate. This match condition can be used to suppress a contributor in an
aggregate route.

\hline

114 &
Multicast scope value of IPv4 or IPv6 multicast group address. The
multicast-scoping name corresponds to an IPv4 prefix. You can match on a
specific multicast-scoping prefix or on a range of prefixes.
& multicast-scoping & match ip address? & ?? & ?? \\
\hline

115 &
Neighbor addresses.  For BGP, the address can be a directly connected or
indirectly connected peer.  For all other protocols, the address is the neighbor
from which the advertisement is received.

\hline

116 &
Next-hop address or addresses specified in the routing information for a
particular route. For BGP routes, matches are performed against each protocol

\hline

120 &
Preference value. You can specify a primary preference value (preference) and a
secondary preference value (preference2). The preference value can be a number
from 0 through 4,294,967,295 (232 â€“ 1). A lower number indicates a more
preferred route.
& preference$[$1--2$]$ & match metric &  & 1 \\
\hline

121 &
Named list of IP addresses. You can specify an exact match with incoming routes.
& prefix-list & match ip address & network / prefix-length &\\

being advertised. It can be one of the following: access, access-internal,
aggregate, bgp, direct, dvmrp, isis, local, ospf, pim-dense, pim-sparse, rip,
ripng, or static.
& protocol & match source-protocol & protocol &\\

List of multicast source addresses. When specifying a source address, you can
specify an exact match with a specific route or a less precise match using match
types.
& source-address-filter & match ip address? & ?? & ?? \\
\hline

128 &
Tag value. You can specify two tag strings: tag (for the first string) and
tag2. These values are local to the router and can be set on configured routes
or by using an import routing policy.  You can specify multiple tags under one
match condition by including the tags within a bracketed list.  For OSPF and
IS-IS, the tag and tag2 match conditions match the 32-bit tag field in external
link-state advertisement (LSA) packets. 
& tag$[$2$]$ & match tag &  & 2 \\
\hline

129 &
To base policy routing on the Level 3 length of a packet, use the match length
command in route-map configuration mode.

Named match conditions.  Essentially a macro for match conditions.

301 &
Tracing policy execution in a file.
& 3 \\
\hline

302 &
Final action.  In addition to specifying an action using the then statement in a
named term, you can also specify an action using the then statement in an
unnamed term.  (A bit like ``finally'' in exception handling.)
& 2 \\
\hline

303 &
Policy expressions.  Policy expressions give the policy framework software a
different way to evaluate routing policies. A policy expression uses Boolean
logical operators with policies. The logical operators establish rules by which
the policies are evaluated.
& 4 \\
\hline

304 &
Route list actions.  If you specify route lists in the from statement, for each
route in the list, you can specify an action to take on that individual route
directly, without including a then statement.
& 5 \\
\hline

305 &
Routing policies and forwarding table interactions.  Allows you to set ``class
of service'' and do load balancing.
& ?? \\
\hline

306 &
Testing routing policies.  Before applying a routing policy in a live
environment, you can use the test policy command to ensure that the policy
produces the results that you expect. 
& 5 \\
\hline

307 &
Ensuring consistency and compatibility with Juniper.  Ensure that commands
match, {\em e.g.}, localpref $\to$ local-preference.  Ensure that syntax
matches, {\em e.g.,} BGP AS-path regular expressions.  Ensure that outcome of
commands matches that of Juniper.

\hline

308 &
Per peer BGP policies.  Ability to attach policies to specific BGP peers.

Per group BGP policies.  Attach policies at a group granularity.  XORP currently
does not support groups.

314 &
Policies on a routing table / instance (RIB) granularity.

Make the front-end policy configuration syntax more natural.  Currently the
syntax for configuring policies is at times awkward due to limitations in XORP's
configuration parser.

Specialized types and operators.  The policy back-end supports very generic types
({\em e.g.} strings) and operations on these can be slow.  Creating specialized
types and operators will speed up policy execution.
& 4 \\
\hline

401 &
Bytecode / machine representation for running the policy.  Currently policies
are represented as a parse-tree.  It may be more efficient to represent them as
bytecode or indeed native code that can be quickly run.
& 15 \\
\hline

402 &
Avoid route copying.  In some cases ({\em e.g.} BGP), the only way to modify a
route is create a new one and modify it.  Given that policies often modify
routes this incurs both a time and memory overhead.  It may be possible to
reduce this.
& 5 \\
\hline

403 &
General performance optimizations.  Various optimizations such as, where
possible, using directly indexed arrays rather than (say) STL maps.  Any other
general programming tricks.
& 3 \\
\hline

404 &
Profiling and optimizing specific cases.  This will involve taking individual
protocols and studying their overhead at a more microscopic scale in order to
eliminate inefficiencies.  The policy back-end will be scrutinized too.

Design and implement route pushing.  Route pushing ({\em i.e.,} refiltering
routes upon a policy change) is currently implemented in an ad-hoc manner in
each protocol.  This code is very difficult to get right and it indeed causes
many bugs.  It needs to be designed and implemented by the generic policy
framework, and protocols should make use of this single implementation.
& 10 \\
\hline

501 &
Design and refactor the policy front-end.  The policy front-end was never
designed properly but was instead just coded in an ad-hoc manner and very
quickly.  As requirements increased with time, the current functionality of the
policy manager is rather complicated.  It needs to deal with dependencies
between policies, lists and policies, and special cases such as BGP per-peer
policies.  The code is currently unmantinable and will be a major source of bugs
and development slowdown.
