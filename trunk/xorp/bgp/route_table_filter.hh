/**
 * @short specialized BGPRouteTable implementing a filter bank to
 * modify or drop routes.
 *
 * The XORP BGP is internally implemented as a set of pipelines
 * consisting of a series of BGPRouteTables.  Each pipeline receives
 * routes from a BGP peer, stores them, and applies filters to them to
 * modify the routes.  Then the pipelines converge on a single
 * decision process, which decides which route wins amongst possible
 * alternative routes.  After decision, the winning routes fanout
 * again along a set of pipelines, again being filtered, before being
 * transmitted to peers.
 *
 * FilterTable is a BGPRouteTable that can hold banks of route
 * filters.  Normally FilterTable propagates add_route,
 * delete_route and the response to lookup_route directly through from
 * the parent to the child.  A route filter can cause these to not be
 * be propagated, or can modify the attributes of the route in the
 * message.
 *
 * Typically there are two FilterTables for each peer, one in the
 * input branch from that peer, and one in the output branch to that
 * peer.  A FilterTable does not store the routes it modifies.  Thus
 * is is normally followed by a CacheTable which stores those routes
 * for later use.
