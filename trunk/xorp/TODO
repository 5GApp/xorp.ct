* Standardize the version string format return by the
  common_0_1_get_version XRL across all targets.

* Add "-ansi" and "-pedantic" flags to the gcc/g++ compilation flags

* Change configure.in NOT to use AC_EGREP_HEADER to check
  for various fields, etc in system header files. Instead,
  it should use AC_TRY_COMPILE or AC_TRY_RUN.

* Make all #include "config.h" to be #ifdef HAVE_CONFIG_H  (??)

* Make the code as POSIX as possible.

* When checking for AF_ROUTE, AF_NETLINK, etc. in configure.in, instead
  of trying to run the test program, do only try to compile it instead.
  After all, the software may be compiled on a machine that may not be
  used to run the software, hence AF_NETLINK for example may not have
  to be enabled.

* Fix all file names.
  E.g. all names non-capital letters + numbers, and use underscores.
