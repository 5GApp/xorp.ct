	LIBXIPC: Xrl Inter-Process Communication Library

The libxipc library provides inter-process communication for XORP
processes.

Documentation
=============

Overview material is present in:
	$(XORP)/docs/libxipc 

and programming documentation in:
	$(XORP)/devnotes/html/libxipc

Status
======

This code is functional and widely used.  Following the initial
repository opening a second major revision will be committed addresses
the following issues:

o Makes the Finder and FinderClient themselves XRL based.  The Finder
  and FinderClient can use the regular protocol families, and leverage
  the advantages of other processes with regard to speed of change and
  flexibility.

THIS IS NOW A WORK IN PROGRESS SO WE HAVE MANY FINDER RELATED FILES.

o Addresses the file naming anomalies.  The present mix and absence of
  separators in file names are to be made consistent.

o Rework the xrl parser related routines to make them more akin to the
  parsing capabilities of the python scripts used to generate XRL
  interfaces.
