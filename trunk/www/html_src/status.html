<H1>XORP Software Status</H1>
<center><img src="images/processes3.png" alt="XORP processes"></center>
<P>
See the <a href="design_docs.html">design documentation</a> for details of the
XORP processes.
<P>
As of March 2006 (Release 1.2), the status is as follows:
<DL>
<DT><B>RIB</B>

<DD>The basic RIB is complete.  There are probably still some
bugs but the core is reasonably stable. IPv4 and IPv6 are supported,
and both unicast and multicast routes can be stored.
Route redistribution from one routing protocol to another is supported.
There is a mechanism to monitor the status of internal tables.
While regular BGP nexthop resolution using IGP data works, recursive
nexthop resolution does not work.

<DT><B>FEA</B>

<DD>The unicast FEA for DragonFlyBSD (only with XORP-current), FreeBSD, NetBSD,
OpenBSD, Linux,
Mac OS X, Windows Server 2003, the dummy FEA for testing purposes,
and the FEA for Click are basically complete. The multicast FEA (MFEA)
for DragonFlyBSD (only with XORP-current), FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and Linux
is basically
complete. The MFEA for Click doesn't exist.

<P>
<DT><B>POLICY</B>

<DD>A policy module has been integrated with all routing protocols and
the RIB, allowing route redistribution and route filtering. 

<P>
<DT><B>BGP</B>

<DD>The core of BGP is basically complete, with respect to the
functionality described in RFC 4271.  There are probably still some
bugs but the core is reasonably stable.
<P>

In addition, there is also support for multiprotocol externsion
(RFC 2858) multiprotocol extensions for IPv6 (RFC 2545), Communities
(RFC 1997), Capabilities (RFC 3392), route reflection (RFC 2796),
Confederations (RFC 3065) and route flap damping (RFC 2439).

<P>
<DT><B>OSPF</B>

<DD>A reasonably complete OSPF version 2 is available along with support
for Not-So-Stubby areas. This is new code so there may still be some
problems but it seems reasonably stable. OSPF version 2 only supports
IPv4, OSPF version 3 that supports IPv6 is not yet complete.

<P>
<DT><B>RIP</B>

<DD>There are two RIP processes: RIPv2 for IPv4 and RIPng for
IPv6. RIPv2 is functionally complete and includes support for
authentication.  RIPng is written and uses much of the same code
as RIPv2 but needs additional testing.

<P>
<DT><B>IS-IS</B>

<DD>Not yet started.

<P>
<DT><B>PIM-SM</B>

<DD>The PIM-SM implementation (including the Bootstrap mechanism)
is reasonably complete and fairly well tested, though there are still
various minor things that need polishing.  The code appears stable, but
probably there are still some bugs. The SSM support is not yet started.

<P>
<DT><B>IGMP</B>

<DD>The IGMPv1 and v2 implementation is reasonably complete and fairly
well tested, though there are still various minor things that need
polishing.  The IGMPv3 implementation is not yet started.

<P>
<DT><B>MLD</B>

<DD>The MLDv1 implementation is reasonably complete, but
testing continues.  The MLDv2 implementation is not yet started.

<P>
<DT><B>Rtrmgr and Xorpsh Command Line Interface</B>

<DD>The rtrmgr is capable of starting up and using xorpsh, a user can
reconfigure the XORP processes that comprise a router. However, work
continues on improving its stability. Operational mode (monitoring a running
router) needs more polishing.

<P>
<DT><B>LibXIPC</B>

<DD>The interfaces are stable, and the IPC mechanisms work well.
<P>
<DT><B>SNMP</B>

<DD>We are using the Net-SNMP agent.  We provide a XORP interface module that
allows MIB modules to access information from XORP processes.  Currently we
have fully implemented one such module, BGP4-MIB (RFC 1657).  The rtrmgr
can be configured to start the SNMP agent and to load MIB modules.
However, it has not been tested as well as the rest of the XORP modules,
hence there could be some issues (see <a href="snmp.html">here</a>).
