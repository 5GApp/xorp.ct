XORP is the industry's only extensible open source routing platform.
It is in broad use worldwide, with thousands of downloads by companies
and educational institutions and an active international developer
community.  Designed for extensibility from the start, XORP provides a
fully featured platform that implements IPv4 and IPv6 routing
protocols and a unified platform to configure them.  It is the only
open source platform to offer integrated multicast capability.  XORP's
modular architecture allows rapid introduction of new protocols,
features and functionality, including support for custom hardware and
software forwarding.

<p>
Today is a big day for XORP. 
</p>

<p>
First off, we're announcing the XORP 1.5 Release and would like to
extend our sincere thanks to the contributors and other community
members who helped make it happen.  We hope you'll visit our site <a
href="http://xorp.org">http://xorp.org</a>, download our code, play
with it, challenge it, build on it, extend it ...  And, most
importantly, send us feedback about your experience and what you'd
like to see in XORP and do with XORP going forward.
</p>

<p>
We're also announcing today the formation of XORP, Inc. <a
href="http://xorp.net">http://xorp.net</a>, a startup founded by the
leaders of the XORP.org project, funded by two top-tier VC's, Onset
Ventures and Highland Capital Partners, and led by network industry
veteran and seasoned entrepreneur, Vivek Ragavan.  XORP, Inc. is
committed both to supporting the XORP.org community and code base and
to building a successful open source business.  XORP 1.5 is the first
community release to be made under the auspices of XORP, Inc. and we
will continue to release community versions of XORP on a regular
basis.  You'll hear more about XORP, Inc.'s product plans in the
months to come.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we want to thank the International Computer Science Institute
(ICSI) in Berkeley, CA which until now has hosted the XORP.org project
and housed the core team of developers.  ICSI's support, together with
that of XORP.org's industrial and government sponsors, has been
essential in making this a big day.
