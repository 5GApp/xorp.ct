<h1>Welcome to XORP</h1>

<p>
XORP is the eXtensible Open Router Platform.
</p>

<p>
XORP is the industry's only extensible open source routing platform.
It is in broad use worldwide, with thousands of downloads by companies
and educational institutions and an active international developer
community.  Designed for extensibility from the start, XORP provides a
fully featured platform that implements IPv4 and IPv6 routing
protocols and a unified platform to configure them.  It is the only
open source platform to offer integrated multicast capability.  XORP's
modular architecture allows rapid introduction of new protocols,
features and functionality, including support for custom hardware and
software forwarding.
</p>

<!--
<p>Our <a href="xorp_vision.html">goal</a> is to develop an open
source software router platform that is stable and fully featured
enough for <a href="xorp_vision.html#operators">production use</a>,
and flexible and extensible enough to enable <a
href="xorp_vision.html#research">network research</a>.  <a
href="status.html">Currently</a> XORP implements routing protocols for
IPv4 and IPv6 and a unified means to configure them.  In future, we
would also like to support <a href="xorp_vision.html#vendors">custom
hardware</a> and software forwarding architectures.
