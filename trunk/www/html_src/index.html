<h1> Welcome to XORP </h1>

<p> XORP is the eXtensible Open Router Platform.

<p>Our <a href="papers.html">goal</a> is to develop an open source software router platform that
is stable and fully featured enough for production use, and 
flexible and extensible enough to enable network research.
<a href="status.html">Currently</a> XORP implements routing protocols for IPv4 and IPv6 and a unified
means to configure them.  In future, we would also like to support
custom hardware and software forwarding architectures.

<p>XORP is free. It is covered by a BSD-style <a
href="license.html">license</a> and is publicly available for
research, development, and use.

<p> The core team is based at the <a
href="http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu">International Computer Science
Institute</A> in Berkeley, California, but contributors come from
around the world.

<h2>The 1.0 Release Has Arrived</h2>

<p>The 1.0 release is now available. The 1.0 release is the first
release that we recommend people use for routing.

<h2>Feedback</h2>

<p>If you are using XORP then we are very keen to hear from you. How
are you using XORP? Which protocols are you using? What research has
XORP enabled?  What new features would you like to see? Please email <a
href="mailto:feedback@xorp.org">feedback@xorp.org</a>
