<h1>SNMP Support in XORP</h1>

<P>
If you wish to have SNMP support in XORP, you need to have <a
href="http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/">net-snmp</a> installed.  
The version of net-snmp matters.  XORP needs at least version 5.0.6.

<P>
Although XORP does have SNMP support, at the present time we have very
few MIBs implemented, so SNMP is of somewhat limited use.  We will
increase the number of MIBs supported as time permits. To compile XORP
without SNMP support, use the following option to configure:
<PRE>
./configure --without-snmp
</PRE>

<h2>Known SNMP-related issues</h2>
On FreeBSD, net-snmp version 5.0.9 works with no known problems.  

<P>
On some versions of Linux, there are some bugs in net-snmp versions 5.0.8 and
5.0.9, which prevent dynamic loading from working.
A patch for net-snmp version 5.0.8 is available <a
href="http://sf.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=708409&group_id=12694&atid=112694">here</a>.
A patch for net-snmp version 5.0.9 is available <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=905573&group_id=12694&atid=456380">here</a>.
If you need one of those patches, XORP's configure program should display a
warning.

<P>
Version 5.1 of net-snmp requires a simple modification, otherwise
XORP will fail to compile.  A patch that can be applied to a
net-snmp-5.1 installation is available <a href="net-snmp-patch.txt">here</a>.
