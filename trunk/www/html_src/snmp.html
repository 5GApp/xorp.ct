<h1>SNMP Support in XORP</h1>
<P>
If you wish to have SNMP support in XORP, you need to have <a
href="http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/">net-snmp</a> installed.  
<P>
The version of net-snmp matters.  XORP needs at least version 5.0.6.
<P>
On FreeBSD, net-snmp version 5.0.9 works with no known problems.  
<P>
On some versions of Linux, there is a bug in net-snmp 5.0.9, which prevents
dynamic loading from working.  A patch is available <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=905573&group_id=12694&atid=456380">here</a>.
If you need this patch, XORP's configure program should display a warning.
<P>
Version 5.1 does NOT work without modification.  XORP will fail to
compile.  A patch that can be applied to an installed net-snmp 5.1
installation is available <a href="net-snmp-patch.txt">here</a>.
<P>
Although XORP does have SNMP support, at the present time we have very
few MIBs implemented, so SNMP is of somewhat limited use.  We will
increase the number of MIBs supported as time permits. To compile XORP
without SNMP support, use the following option to configure:
<PRE>
./configure --without-snmp
</PRE>
