<h1>The XORP Vision</h1>

XORP is called an <I>extensible</I> router platform for good reason.  We believe that by designing for extensibility from the outset, we can simultaneously satisfy several different user groups:
<UL>

<LI>Network researchers needing a platform for experimentation.</LI>

<LI>Network operators needing a cheap stable routing platform on
commodity hardware.</LI>

<LI>Network equipment vendors with special purpose hardware.</LI>

<LI>Network application writers looking for an open platform to
support their applications.</LI>
</UL>

Only time will tell if we're right, but in this note we'll try and
explain where we hope to go.  Of course we'll only get there with good
luck and a lot of help from all of these communities.

<h2>Network Research</h2>

There are a lot of very smart people in the network research
community, but it's hard for many of these people to do experiments
that give meaningful results.  A lot of work happens in simulation,
but often it's hard to know whether the simulation bears much
relationship to reality.  There's really no substitute for trying
something out in the real world.  This is where XORP comes in.
<P>
Here are some examples of how XORP can be used:
<UL>

<LI> If XORP is used as a production router, it is easy to instrument
it to perform measurements of traffic, routing messages, or
practically anything else that goes on in a router.  </LI>

<LI> XORP can be used as a platform to develop new routing protocols.
XORP has no built-in concept of which routing protocols exists, so you
can easily add your own, together with an ASCII <a
href="releases/current/docs/rtrmgr/rtrmgr.pdf">configuration template
file</a>, so the XORP command line interface knows what new
functionality is available.</LI>

<LI> XORP can be used as a <a
href="http://tel.fer.hr/imunes/index.en.shtml">network emulator</a>.
XORP's Forwarding Engine Abstraction (FEA) process provides an
abstract interface through which the whole control plane communicates
with the forwarding plane and the outside world.  It is possible to
modify the FEA so that multiple emulated routers all exist on the same
host.  This allows experiments using XORP's real routing code to take
place in a carefully controlled environment.  It also facilitates new
protocol development without needing a large lab of machines.</LI>

<LI>XORP is scriptable.  XORP's internal communication between
processes uses <a
href="/releases/current/docs/libxipc/libxipc_overview.pdf">XRLs</a>.
These have a canonical form that is ASCII, such as <pre>
finder://fea/fti/0.1/add_route?net:ipv4net=10.0.0.1/8&gateway:ipv4=192.150.187.1</pre>
There's a command line program <B>call_xrl</B> that allows any
scripting language to make calls to any XORP process and get back the
response.  How you use this scripting capability is up to you, but we
think it is unique in it's ability to allow novel uses of existing
router code.</LI>
</UL>

<h2>XORP as a Cheap Router</h2>
<P>
There are many organizations that need router functionality, but
cannot justifybuying an expensive commercial router.  Although there
are cheap home routers available these days, they are not really
intended to run any non-trivial routing configuration.  A modern $300
PC has enough forwarding capability to saturate a few 100Mb/s network
links, and ethernet NICs are extremely cheap, so with a little
knowledge, it's very viable to build your own PC-based router.
<P>
We offer XORP as a Live CD - a CD image that you can burn to a
bootable CD which allows you to run XORP without installing any
software or knowing anything about Unix system administration.  As it
runs from a readonly CD, this configuration is more secure than a
normal Unix installation.
<P>
The goal is that you shouldn't need to know anything about how XORP
works internally to run it as a router.  XORP has a single unified
command line interface which allows all the routing protocols, network
interfaces, and so forth to be configured.  In future releases, this
CLI will also be extended to encompass additional router functionality
such as queue manangement, QoS configuration, firewalls, NATs and DHCP
configuration.
<P>
XORP already supports IPv4 and IPv6, together with BGP4+ and RIP for
unicast routing, PIM-SM and IGMPv2 for multicast, and limited SNMP
support.  
<P>
It is very important to us that XORP is both very stable and has
sufficient features for mission production use.  We'll realise this
goal only with extensive feedback from our users we regards to what
works well in the real world, and what doesn't.
