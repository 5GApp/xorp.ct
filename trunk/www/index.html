<h2> What is Xorp? </h2>
<P>
<i>Xorp</i> (pronounced <i>z-o-r-p</i>)is an open router software platform
being developed 
primarily at the <a href=http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/>International
Computer Science Institute</a> in Berkeley.  The goal is to produce a
complete set of router software that is stable enough and fully
featured enough for production use, initially on edge routers, but
also due to our focus on extensibility, to be an excellent platform
for Internet research.  

<p>The following documents give more information:
<UL>
<LI><a href="papers/xorp-hotnets.pdf">Xorp goals and architecture</a> (Sept
2002).
<LI><a href="current-release/docs/index.html">Software overview</a>
<LI><a href="current-release/docs/kdoc/html/index.html">Detailed source code documentation</a>
<LI>Initial <a href=papers/osr.ps>project proposal and design overview</a> (Nov
2000).
<LI>Xorp is using the <a href=http://www.pdos.lcs.mit.edu/click/>Click</a> Modular Router as its primary forwarding path.
</UL>

<p> Xorp is <a href="license.html">free software</a>. We are extremely
grateful to Intel and the National Science Foundation for providing
the initial funding to develop Xorp.

<h2>Getting Xorp</h2>

<p>
As of March 2003, Xorp is alpha release research software.  This
means it's not ready for use as a router, but has reached the stage
where the architecture is basically complete and it might be used as
the basis for research.  See the <a href="current-release/docs/status.html">current
status</a> of the different parts of Xorp.

<ul>
<li>Release 0.2, an alpha version of Xorp, is available for 
<a href="downloads.html">download</a>. 

<li> The Xorp distribution is also available through
our <a href="cvs.html">anonymous CVS server</a>. 
</ul>

<P>
Please note that to build all the Xorp modules and test programs with
debugging enabled, you will need nearly 1GB of free disk space.  Xorp
is written in C++, and has been developed on <B>FreeBSD 4.x</B> and
<B>Redhat Linux 7.2</B>.  The current release 0.1 is known to compile
with gcc 2.95.x and 2.96 only and <i>not</i> gcc 3.x.

<hr><h2>Quotes</h2>
A search on Google turned up this quote:
<P>
<DL>
<DD><I> Peperdos' moustache drooped. "I fear, my son, even should you
come to possess all this virtue, you cannot help the world. For the
highest virtue of all has vanished entirely, and people nowadays
scarcely know what it is anymore."
<P>The saucer-boy was afraid to ask what this cardinal virtue was, for
fear of being lumped in with "people nowadays."
<P>
"Xorp," Peperdos answered, without waiting for a question. "Xorp has
vanished from the world. Our statesmen and generals in the Army hardly
know what Xorp is anymore. The young generation have forsaken Xorp
entirely. We are in a Xorpless age, my son, and without Xorp, mighty
deeds will not be done."</I>
