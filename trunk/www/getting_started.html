There are three ways to try out XORP.
<UL>
<LI><a href="downloads.html">Download</a> a release, and <a
href="#compiling">compile</a> it from source.
<LI>Get the current source snapshot <a href="cvs.html">from CVS</a> and <a
href="#compiling">compile</a> it.
<LI>Download a <a href="livecd.html">live CD</a>, and try out a
precompiled release.
</UL>
If you want to develop new functionality for XORP, you'll obviously
need to compile from source, but the live CD provides a way to try
XORP out without needing to worry about having the right compilers or
operating system installed.

XORP should be fairly portable.  At the present time, the main
development platforms for XORP are FreeBSD and Linux.  XORP should run
on all recent versions of FreeBSD (as of April 2004, we recommend
FreeBSD 4.9) and on most versions of Linux with a 2.4.x kernel.
<P>
XORP compiles on MacOS 10.2 or later, but there is not currently any
forwarding support.  If you try XORP on another platform, let us know
how you fare.  See <a href="#porting">porting</a> if you're interested
in porting XORP to a new platform.
<P>
We aim to add Windows XP to our supported platforms during 2004.

XORP is written in C++.  We've endeavoured to comply as far as
possible with the ANSI standards, but currently XORP has only been
compiled with variants of gcc.  XORP is known to compile on gcc
2.95.x, 2.96, 3.2.x, 3.3.x, and pre-releases of 3.4.
<P>
Our <a href="#tinderbox">tinderbox</a> checks daily that XORP still
compiles and passes its validation tests with 2.95.4, 3.3.4, and
3.4-prerelease.  The aim is that you should always be able to check
out a current source snapshot from CVS, compile it, and have it pass
all the internal validation tests.  We don't always succeed, but
failures identified by the tinderbox are always fixed very rapidly.
<P>
To compile XORP requires nearly 1GB of free disk space, and up to an
hour depending on your CPU speed and the version of the compiler
you're using.  Much of this is spent compiling the validation tests,
which are always built by default.
<P>
To compile XORP, you will need <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html">gmake</a>
installed. This is the default on Linux but not on FreeBSD.
<P>
Assuming you have a checked out copy of the XORP source, you should be
able to compile XORP by typing (in the top-level XORP source directory
where the file "VERSION" is located):
<PRE>
# ./configure
# gmake
</PRE>
Note: gmake may be installed as make on some platforms.  Then go away
and have a coffee or two.
<P>
This will build XORP "in place".  That is, the bgp binary (xorp_bgp)
will be left in the bgp subdirectory, the XORP shell binary (xorpsh)
will be left in the rtrmgr directory, and so on.  This default can be
overridden (for example, if you're cross-compiling multiple platforms
from the same source), but there's no need to if you're just starting
out.

<P>
Assuming the compilation completed without errors, you should now
validate that the build actually runs correctly.  In the top-level
directory, type:
<PRE>
# gmake check
</PRE>
This will run all the internal validation tests for all the XORP
modules.  This is a rather lengthy procedure (nearly an hour), but
it's a good idea to be sure that everything is working.
<P>
The debugging output can sometimes be a little excessive, but what
you're looking for is lines like:
<pre>
PASS: test_trie
</pre>
which indicates that a particular test program completed successfully.
Hopefully you won't see any lines like:
<pre>
FAIL: test_peering1.sh
</pre>
which indicates a particular validation test failed.
<P>
There can be warnings such as:
<pre>
[ 2004/04/22 00:48:57 WARNING coord BGP ] TCP connection 
from test_peer: peer1 to localhost closed
</pre>
Unless these result in a FAIL message, they are typically
transient artifacts of the testing methodology, and can safely be
ignored.

XORP tries to hide from the operator the internal structure of the
software, so that the operator only needs to know the right commands
to use to configure the router.  The operator should not need to know
that XORP is internally composed of multiple processes, nor what those
processes do.  All the operator needs to see is a single router
configuration file that determines the startup configuration, and a
single command line interface that can be used to configure XORP.
<P>
There is a single XORP process that manages the whole XORP router -
this is called <B>xorp_rtrmgr</B> (short for XORP Router Manager).  If
you built XORP from source using the defaults, the xorp_rtrmgr binary
will be in the rtrmgr subdirectory.
<P>
xorp_rtrmgr will expect to find a configuration file in the same
directory it is started from.  By default this configuration file is
called <B>config.boot</B>.  There's a sample config.boot file in the
rtrmgr directory - please <B>do not</B> use this without tailoring the
IP addresses, interfaces and routing protocols to match your local
network environment.  You can specify a different filename for the
configuration file using the -b command line flag.  The -n "no
execute" flag will cause xorp_rtrmgr to startup and pretend the router
is operating normally, but to not actually start any processes.  This
can be used to check configuration files.
<P>
Typically xorp_rtrmgr must be run as root.  This is because it starts
up processes that need privileged access to insert routes into
the forwarding path in the kernel.
<P>
If you are using the live CD, then xorp_rtrmgr should start by default
after the OS has booted, and read the config.boot file from the floppy
drive.
<P>
To interact with the router via the command line interface, the
operator uses the XORP command shell <B>xorpsh</B>.  If you compiled
from source, this should also be in the rtrmgr subdirectory.  xorpsh
should not normally be run as root, but if a user is going to change
the configuration of the router (as opposed to simply monitor the
router's operation) then they need to be in the "xorp" Unix group.  If
you are using the live CD then, by default, logging in as username
xorp should cause the user's login shell to be xorpsh.
<P>
The <a
href="/releases/current/docs/rtrmgr/xorpsh_userguide.pdf">xorpsh user
manual</a> (PDF) provides basic information about how to use xorpsh.
The "help" command also provides basic online help.  To learn how to
configure specific routing protocols, interface IP addresses, and so
forth, you need to see the <a
href="/releases/current/docs/index.html">relevant user manuals</a>.

<P>
A XORP router must be configured to perform the desired operations.
The configuration information can be provided in one of the two ways:
<UL>
<LI>Use a configuration file when the rtrmgr is started.
    By default, the rtrmgr will load the configuration from file
    "config.boot" in the XORP installation directory.
    This file can be specified by the "-b <filename> command line
    option:
<PRE>
    xorp_rtrmgr -b my_config.boot
</PRE>

    See <A href="releases/current/config.boot.sample.txt">
    rtrmgr/config.boot.sample</A> for an example of a
    configuration file (note that this file MUST be modified
    before using it).

<LI>Use the xorpsh command line interface after the rtrmgr is started.
   It should be noted that command line completion in the xorpsh
   does greatly simplify configuration.
</UL>

A mixture of both methods is permissible. For example,
a configuration file can also be loaded from within the xorpsh.

<H3>Network Interfaces</H3>

A XORP router will only use interfaces that it has been explicitly
configured to use. Even for protocols such as BGP that are agnostic to
interfaces, if the next-hop router for a routing entry is not through
a configured interface routes the route will not be installed.
For protocols that are explicitly aware of interfaces only configured
interfaces will be used.
<P>
Every physical network device in the system is considered to be an
"interface". Every interface can contain a number of virtual
interfaces ("vif"s). In the majority of cases the interface name and vif
name will be identical and will map to the name given to the interface
by the operating system. A virtual interface is configured with the address
or addresses that should be used. At each level in the configuration
hierarchy ("interface", "vif" and "address") it is necessary to enable
this part of the configuration.

<PRE>
interfaces {
    interface dc0 {
	description: "data interface"
	enabled: true
	/* default-system-config */
	vif dc0 {
	    enabled: true
	    address 10.10.10.10 {
		prefix-length: 24
		broadcast: 10.10.10.255
		enabled: true
	    }
/*
	    address 10:10:10:10:10:10:10:10 {
		prefix-length: 64
		enabled: true
	    }
*/
	}
    }
}
</PRE>

We recommend that you select the interfaces that you want to use on
your system and configure them as above. If you are configuring an
interface that is currently being used by the the system make sure
that there is no mismatch in the "address", "prefix-length" and
"broadcast" arguments.
If the "default-system-config" statement is used, it
instructs the FEA that the interface should be configured by using
the existing interface information from the underlying system.
In that case, the "vif"s and "address"es must not be configured.

<H3>Forwarding Engine Abstraction</H3>

It is a requirement to explicitly enable forwarding for each
protocol family.

<PRE>
fea {
    enable-unicast-forwarding4: true
    /* enable-unicast-forwarding6: true */
}
</PRE>

If IPv4 forwarding is required you will require the configuration
above.
<P>
Now that we have configured the interfaces and enabled forwarding we
need to configure some routing protocols.

<H3>Protocols</H3>

<H4>Static Routes</H4>

This is the simplest routing protocol in XORP. It allows the
installation of unicast or multicast static routes (either IPv4 or IPv6).
Note that in case of multicast the routes are installed only in the user-level
Multicast Routing Information Base and are used for multicast-specific
reverse-path information by multicast routing protocols such as PIM-SM.

<PRE>
protocols {
    static {
	route4 10.20.0.0/16 {
	    nexthop: 10.10.10.20
	    metric: 1
	}
	mrib-route4 10.20.0.0/16 {
	    nexthop: 10.10.10.30
	    metric: 1
	}
/*
	route6 20:20:20:20::/64 {
	    nexthop: 10:10:10:10:10:10:10:20
	    metric: 1
	}
	mrib-route6 20:20:20:20::/64 {
	    nexthop: 10:10:10:10:10:10:10:30
	    metric: 1
	}
*/
    }
}
</PRE>

Static routes can be redistributed through the RIP protocol using RIP's
"import" statement.

<H4>Routing Information Protocol</H4>

In order to run RIP it is sufficient to specify the "interface"s, "vif"s
and "address"es on which RIP is enabled. Remember that each "address"
must be explicitly enabled.
<P>
If you wish to announce routes then it is necessary to "import" the
routes that are to be announced. For example, "connected", "static" and
"rip".

<PRE>
protocols {
    rip {
/*
	import connected {
	    metric: 1
	    tag: 0
	}
*/
	interface dc0 {
	    vif dc0 {
		address 10.10.10.10 {
		    enabled: true
/*
		    metric: 1
		    horizon: "split-horizon-poison-reverse"
		    passive: false
		    accept-non-rip-requests: true
		    accept-default-route: false
		    advertise-default-route: false
		    route-expiry-secs: 180
		    route-deletion-secs: 120
		    triggered-update-min-secs: 1
		    triggered-update-max-secs: 5
		    table-announce-min-secs: 25
		    table-announce-max-secs: 35
		    table-request-secs: 1
		    interpacket-delay-msecs: 50
*/
		}
	    }
	}
    }
}
</PRE>

All the parameters the RIP will take are specified above for
completeness. If the "address" parameters in comments are not
specified then sensible defaults will be chosen.

<H4>Border Gateway Protocol</H4>

In order to run BGP the "bgp-id" (BGP Identifier) and "local-as"
(Autonomous System number) must be specified.
<P>
The "peer" statement specifies a peering. The argument to the peer
statement is the IP address of the peer. The "local-ip" is the IP
address that TCP should use. The "as" is the Autonomous System Number
of the peer.

<PRE>
protocols {
    bgp {
	bgp-id: 10.10.10.10
	local-as: 65002

	peer 10.30.30.30 {
	    local-ip: 10.10.10.10
	    as: 65000
	    next-hop: 10.10.10.20
/*
	    local-port: 179
	    peer-port: 179
*/
	    /* holdtime: 120 */
	    /* enabled: true */

	    /* Optionally enable other AFI/SAFI combinations */
	    /* enable-ipv4-multicast */

            /* enable-ipv6-unicast */
            /* enable-ipv6-multicast */
	}

	/* Originate IPv4 Routes */
/*
	network4 10.10.10.0/24 {
	    next-hop: 10.10.10.10
	    unicast: true
	    multicast: true
	}
*/

	/* Originate IPv6 Routes */
/*
	network6 10:10:10:10::/64 {
	    next-hop: 10:10:10:10:10:10:10:10
	    unicast: true
	    multicast: true
	}
*/
    }
}
</PRE>

Currently BGP is not able to "import" routes from other routing
protocols such as "static". It is however possible to originate routes
using network statements such as in the above example.


<H4>Multicast Forwarding Engine Abstraction</H4>

The MFEA must be configured if the XORP router is to be used for multicast
routing. The MFEA for IPv4 and IPv6 are configured separately.
<P>
In the configuration we must explicitly enable the entity itself, and
each "vif". The "traceoptions" section is used to explicitly enable
log information that can be used for debugging purpose.

<PRE>
plumbing {
    mfea4 {
	enabled: true
	interface dc0 {
	    vif dc0 {
		enabled: true
	    }
	}
	interface register_vif {
	    vif register_vif {
		/* Note: this vif should be always enabled */
		enabled: true
	    }
	}
	traceoptions {
	    flag all {
		enabled: true
	    }
	}
    }
}

plumbing {
    mfea6 {
	enabled: true
	interface dc0 {
	    vif dc0 {
		enabled: true
	    }
	}
	interface register_vif {
	    vif register_vif {
		/* Note: this vif should be always enabled */
		enabled: true
	    }
	}
	traceoptions {
	    flag all {
		enabled: true
	    }
	}
    }
}
</PRE>

Note that the interface/vif named "register_vif" is special.
If PIM-SM is configured, then "register_vif" must be enabled
in the MFEA.

<H4>Internet Group Management Protocol/Multicast Listener Discovery</H4>

IGMP/MLD should be configured if the XORP router is to be used for multicast
routing and if we want to track multicast group membership for directly
connected subnets. Typically this is the case for a multicast router,
therefore it should be enabled. IGMP and MLD are configured separately:
IGMP is used for tracking IPv4 multicast members; MLD is used for tracking
IPv6 multicast members.
<P>
In the configuration we must explicitly enable each entity and
each "vif". The "traceoptions" section is used to explicitly enable
log information that can be used for debugging purpose.

<PRE>
protocols {
    igmp {
	enabled: true
	interface dc0 {
	    vif dc0 {
		enabled: true
	    }
	}
	traceoptions {
	    flag all {

	    }
	}
    }

protocols {
    mld {

	    }
	}
	traceoptions {
	    flag all {
		enabled: true
	    }
	}
    }
}
</PRE>

<H4>Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode</H4>

PIM-SM should be configured if the XORP router is to be used for
multicast routing in PIM-SM domain. PIM-SM for IPv4 and IPv6 are
configured separately. At minimum, the entity itself and the
virtual interfaces should be enabled, and the mechanism for obtaining
the Candidate-RP set (either the Bootstrap mechanism, or a static-RP set).

<PRE>
protocols {
    pimsm4 {
	enabled: true

A number of parameters have default values, therefore
they don't have to be configured (those parameters are commented-out
in the above sample configuration).
<P>
Note that the interface/vif named "register_vif" is special
If PIM-SM is configured, then "register_vif" must be enabled.
<P>
The "dr-priority" parameter is used to configure the Designated Router
priority per virtual interface (note that in case of "register_vif"
it is not used).
<P>
The "alternative-subnet" statement is used to add "alternative subnets"
to a network interface. For example, if you want to make incoming traffic
with a non-local source address appear as it is coming from a local subnet,
then "alternative-subnet" can be used. Typically, this is needed as a
work-around solution when we use uni-directional interfaces for
receiving traffic (e.g., satellite links).
Note: use "alternative-subnet" with extreme care, only if you know
what you are really doing!
<P>
If PIM-SM uses static RPs, those can be configured within the
"static-rps" section. For each RP, an "rp" section is needed, and each
section should contain the multicast prefix address the static RP is
configured with. The RP priority can be modified with the "rp-priority"
parameter.
<P>
If PIM-SM uses the Bootstrap mechanism to obtain the Candidate-RP set,
that can be configured in the "bootstrap" section.
If the XORP router is to be used as a Candidate-BSR, this should be
specified in the "cand-bsr" section.
For a router to be a Candidate-BSR it must advertise for
each zone (scoped or non-scoped) the associated multicast prefix address.
The "cand-bsr" section should contain "scope-zone" statements for each
multicast prefix address.
The vif name with the address that is to be used as the Candidate-BSR
is specified by the "cand-bsr-by-vif-name" statement.
The Candidate-BSR priority can be modified with the "bsr-priority"
parameter.
<P>
If the XORP router is to be a Candidate-RP, this should be specified
in the "cand-rp" section.
For a router to be a Candidate-RP it must advertise for
each zone (scoped or non-scoped) the associated multicast prefix address.
The "cand-rp" section should contain "group-prefix" statements for each
multicast prefix address.
The vif name with the address that is to be used as the Candidate-RP
is specified by the "cand-rp-by-vif-name" statement.
The Candidate-RP priority can be modified with the
"rp-priority" parameter; the Candidate-RP holdtime can be modified
with the "rp-holdtime" parameter.
<P>
The "is-scope-zone" parameter is used to specify whether a Candidate-BSR
"scope-zone" or a Candidate-RP "group-prefix" is scoped. Currently,
scoped zones are not well tested, hence it is recommended "scope-zone"
is always set to "false".
Note that typically the "hash-mask-len" should not be modified; if you
don't know what "hash-mask-len" is used for, don't modify it!
<P>
The "switch-to-spt-threshold" section can be used to specify the
multicast data bandwidth threshold used by the last-hop PIM-SM routers
and the RPs to initiate shortest-path switch toward the multicast source.
Parameter "interval-sec" is used to specify the periodic measurement interval;
parameter "bytes" is used to specify the threshold in number of bytes
within the measurement interval. It is recommended that the measurement
interval is not too small, and should be on the order of tens of seconds.
<P>
The "traceoptions" section is used to explicitly enable log information
that can be used for debugging purpose.

<H4>FIB2MRIB</H4>

The FIB2MRIB module is used to obtain the Forwarding Information Base
information from the underlying system (via the FEA), and to propagate
it to the MRIB, so it can be used by multicast routing protocols
such as PIM-SM. Typically, it is needed only if the unicast routing
protocols (if any) on that router do not inject routes into the MRIB.
Note that FIB2MRIB is disabled by default, therefore if it is needed
it must be explicitly enabled.

</TD</TR>

<P>
Notes on porting:
<P>
Most of XORP should be relatively portable.  The first requirement is
that you have a compatible C++ compiler.  All recent versions of gcc
should work, but we don't yet know about other compilers.
<P>
The goal is for all of the system dependencies to be in the Forwarding
Engine Abstraction (FEA) process.  To port XORP to a new platform, either an
existing FEA must be ported to that platform, or a new bottom end to
the FEA will need to be written.  FreeBSD and Linux use different bottom
ends to the FEA.
<P>
The libxipc XRL IPC library may need work to port, but this should not
be a significant problem on most platforms.
<P>
System dependencies on raw sockets, and similar things that differ
from OS to OS should not be present in the routing protocols, but
should rather be relayed through requests via the FEA.  At the present
time this is not true of all routing protocols.
