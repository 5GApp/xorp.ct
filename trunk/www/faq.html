<h3>General</h3>

<ol>

  <li> <a name="what"><b>What exactly is XORP?</b></a>

  <P> XORP is <I>intended</I> to provide a complete and extensible
      software stack for an IP router, including routing protocols,
      management mechanisms and an extensible forwarding path.  The
      goal is to provide a <I>platform</I>, by which we mean that XORP
      provides the critical common infrastructure, and we hope other
      people will code novel applications or protocols to run on the
      XORP platform.

  <P> At the present time, XORP doesn't provide it's own forwarding
      path, but rather relies on the forwarding capabilities of the
      underlying operating system.  This means that although the
      control plane is nicely extensible, the forwarding path isn't.
      We have plans to address this in the future using the <a
      href="http://www.pdos.lcs.mit.edu/click/">Click</a> modular
      router code, but intend to keep the option of using native
      forwarding for those that prefer it.

  <P> XORP does provide routing protocols (BGP, RIP, PIM Sparse Mode),
      support protocols (IGMPv2, MLDv1), and management mechanisms
      (command line interface, SNMP).  This list will grow as more
      people start <a href="contributing.html">contributing</a> to
      XORP.

  <P> The XORP core is not intended to be just research-quality code.
      In it's role as a research platform, it is critical that XORP
      can be deployed in production environments.  Thus it's really
      important to us that XORP is stable and secure.  While we have
      an extensive set of internal <a href="#validating">test
      suites</a>, these can only test so much.  True stability will
      only come from real-world testing - if you try XORP, and it
      doesn't do what you expect or hope, please let us know, either
      through email to feedback at xorp.org or <a
      href="http://www.xorp.org/bugzilla/index.cgi">bugzilla</a>.

  <li><b><a name="#procon">What are the pros and cons of XORP?</a></b>

  <p>Pros:
    <ul>

      <li> The code code is open source (under a BSD-like license).
      People can freely use it, customize it, make their own product
      out of it, etc.

      <li> The code runs on commodity PC hardware and operating
      systems.

      <li> The modular design and separation of functional entities into
      distinct processes means that failure of one component does not cause
      the whole router to fail or malfunction.

      <li> The modular design enables future integration with hardware
      forwarding planes.

      <li> XORP components communicate with a flexible IPC scheme.
      Components can run within a single host or be distributed across
      multiple hosts.  There is scope for building a distributed
      router from low-cost PC hardware.

    </ul>

  <p>Cons:
    <ul>

      <li> Software forwarding plane limits forwarding rate.

      <li> The number of hardware and software features are much less
      than the commercial vendors.

      <li> Support options do not exist like the big vendors.  The
      project core does not have the resources to provide this level
      of support.  If a company wants to commercialize XORP, this
      would be one area of differentiation for the commerical product.

    </ul>
    </li>

    <li><b><a name="existing">There are plenty of vendors with modular
    routing software so why is XORP interesting?</a></b>

      <p> There are plenty of reasonably priced router/routing-switch
          options.  However, you have no control over the software
          they run.  If there's a problem, you are at the mercy of the
          vendor to get a fix.  Unless you are a major corporation,
          you may find it hard to get any action.  With XORP and other
          open source open source routing platforms you have the
          source code, you can find and fix problems yourself, and you
          can add features you want.

      <p> If you don't like working with code yourself, you can submit
          XORP bug reports in a public forum.  Since no developer
          likes outstanding bug reports this puts pressure on the
          developers to fix issues and also shows areas where people
          might usefully contribute effort.
  </li>

  <li><b><a name="competition">Is XORP in competition with the
  commerical router vendors?</a></b>

     <p> XORP is primarily a research project.  We're not competing
         with router vendors, we're interested in facilitating routing
         research - providing researchers with a platform where they
         can try out routing ideas.  The code is open source since
         it's hard to help the research community without providing
         the source code.
  </li>

  <li><b><a name="impact">What is the impact on the router market of open
  source routing platforms?</a></b>

     <p> XORP (and other open source routers) may eat into the router
         market at the edges - there is potential to provide cheap and
         reasonably performing edge boxes.  It may also find a home in
         logging and analysis products since there is code that speaks
         assorted protocols - it's not much work to change from
         protocol speaker to protocol reporter.  This is one area
         where other open source routing products find themselves used
         in large enterprises and with ISPs today.
  </li>

  <li><b><a name="#pronounce">How do you pronouce XORP?</a></b>

  <p> We prefer XORP to be pronounced as a single word "zorp".  But we
      won't be offended if you pronounce it in other ways.
  </li>
