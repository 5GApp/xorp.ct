<P>
See the <a href="design_docs.html">design documentation</a> for details of the
XORP processes.
<P>
As of July 2004 (Release 1.0), the status is as follows:
<DL>
<DT><B>RIB</B>

<DD>The basic RIB is complete.  There are probably still some
bugs but the core is reasonably stable. IPv4 and IPv6 are supported,
and both unicast and multicast routes can be stored.
Route redistribution from one routing protocol to another is supported.
There is a mechanism to monitor the status of internal tables.
While regular BGP nexthop resolution using IGP data works, recursive
nexthop resolution does not work.

<DT><B>FEA</B>

<DD>The unicast FEA for FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and Linux, and the dummy FEA
for testing purposes are basically complete.  The FEA for Click doesn't
currently work. The multicast FEA (MFEA) for FreeBSD and
Linux is basically complete.  The MFEA for Click doesn't exist.

<P>
<DT><B>BGP</B>

<DD>The core of BGP is basically complete, with respect to the
functionality described in draft-ietf-idr-bgp4-23.txt.  There are
probably still some bugs but the core is reasonably stable.
<P>
Monitoring is limited to listing all the routes and listing all the
peers - basically all the information demanded by the base BGP MIB.
More fine-grain monitoring is definitely needed.  You can't install
any optional filters, which means in practice it isn't too useful.
Redistribution of routes into BGP currently
doesn't work.  IPv4 and IPv6 routing works. Multicast SAFI has been
implemented and has been tested.

<P>
<DT><B>OSPF</B>

<DD>A reasonably complete port of John Moy's OSPFd (on FreeBSD) to the
XORP environment exists, but it hasn't been well enough tested to know
if it works or doesn't work.  OSPFd is IPv4 only.
<P>
We do not intend to do any futher work on this port as we will be
producing our own OSPF implementation.

<P>
<DT><B>RIP</B>

<DD> There are two RIP processes: RIPv2 for IPv4 and RIPng for IPv6.
     RIPv2 is functionally complete and includes support for
     authentication.  RIPng is written and uses much of the same code
     as RIPv2 but needs requires additional testing.

<P>
<DT><B>IS-IS</B>

<DD>Not yet started.

<P>
<DT><B>PIM-SM</B>

<DD>The PIM-SM implementation (including the Bootstrap mechanism)
is reasonably complete and fairly well tested, though there are still
various minor things that need polishing.  The code appears stable, but
probably there are still some bugs. The SSM support is not yet started.

<P>
<DT><B>IGMP</B>

<DD>The IGMPv1 and v2 implementation is reasonably complete and fairly
well tested, though there are still various minor things that need
polishing.  The IGMPv3 implementation is not yet started.

<P>
<DT><B>MLD</B>

<DD>The MLDv1 implementation is reasonably complete, but
testing continues.  The MLDv2 implementation is not yet started.

<P>
<DT><B>Rtrmgr and Xorpsh Command Line Interface</B>

<DD>The rtrmgr is capable of starting up and using xorpsh, a user can
reconfigure the XORP processes that comprise a router. However, work
continues on improving its stability. Operational mode (monitoring a running
router) needs more polishing.

<P>
<DT><B>LibXIPC</B>

<DD>The interfaces are stable, and the IPC mechanisms work well.  The
finder code from release 0.1 has been replaced with much nicer finder
design, which appears to be stable, but as with all new code there are
probably new bugs.
<P>
<DT><B>SNMP</B>

<DD>We are using the Net-SNMP agent.  We provide a XORP interface module that
allows MIB modules to access information from XORP processes.  Currently we
have fully implemented one such module, BGP4-MIB (RFC 1657).  The rtrmgr
can be configured to start the SNMP agent and to load MIB modules.
