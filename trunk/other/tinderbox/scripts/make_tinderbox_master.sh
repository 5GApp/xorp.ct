#
# Script to create and populate the tinderbox directories on a host
# which is to act as the 'master host', that is, it will invoke builds
# and checks periodically on remote 'slave hosts' and report back on
# the results of those background jobs.
#
# This script should be run as the master tinderbox user, and accepts
# a single argument: where to put the tinderbox itself. This can be
# a different directory from the sandbox user's $HOME.
#
# TBOXCVSROOT is used to check out the tinderbox source.
# TBOXHOME is inferred as the current user's home directory from ${HOME}.
#  There is a sanity check for this directory.
# TBOXMAILTO is used only as a guide.
# TBOXPATH is inferred as ${TBOXHOME}/tinderbox, or the first
#  positional parameter to the script. It will be created if it does
#  not already exist; if it cannot be created, a fatal error occurs.
#  IT MUST BE AN ABSOLUTE PATH.
# TBOXUSER is inferred as the current user from ${USER}.

The Tinderbox has now been built successfully. Please now create a
crontab entry with the following format (as a guide):

SHELL=/bin/sh
PATH=/etc:/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin
HOME=@TBOXPATH@
MAILTO=@TBOXMAILTO@
#
#minute	hour	mday	month	wday	command
0	20	*	*	*	@TBOXPATH@/scripts/tinderbox.sh

The XORP Tinderbox should run using a strictly POSIX 1003.2 compliant
Bourne shell. This includes the FreeBSD /bin/sh, GNU bash in POSIX
mode, and many Korn-style shells.
