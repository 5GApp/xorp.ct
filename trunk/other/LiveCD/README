XORP Live Image Creation Toolkit
================================

The new XORP LiveCD is based on the NanoBSD scripts which ship with
FreeBSD 7.1-RELEASE, modified to produce x86 ISO and x86 bootable USB
images, rather than the usual CompactFlash images.
This builds on the existing work by Poul-Henning Kamp (phk@FreeBSD.org).


Objective
=========

The XORP Live Image Toolkit has the objective of allowing the generation of 
bootable XORP CDs (and USB disk images) based on the FreeBSD operating
system.

The goals of the LiveCD are to allow users to experiment with XORP
without having to go through the process of installing FreeBSD or
Linux and compiling and installing XORP.  A system running off a
LiveCD also makes a great educational tool, and could even be used for
production use.


What is it?
==========

The XORP Live Image Toolkit itself is a set of scripts that will prepare
an image of a working FreeBSD system and the XORP routing
components, based on some questions asked to the user.

A custom made kernel will allow this image to be bootable.  Access to the
hard disks on the system the image is running on has been disabled, so it's
hard for the resulting image to harm any pre-installed operating systems on
the local disk.

The XORP router components needs to have somewhere to save config
files if the router configuration is to be preserved across reboots.
If the system has a USB disk, or is booted from one, XORP can use this to
retain the configuration files.  Otherwise XORP will come up with an empty
configuration every time it is booted.

FreeBSD's rc.initdiskless functionality is used to implement the boot-time
configuration load. Some general modifications have been made.

If running from a CD image, and a USB disk is not plugged in during system
boot, some warning messages will be printed about an optional remount
failing; these may be ignored.


Requirements
============

* To build the XORP Live Image using NanoBSD:

- Run it as ROOT! You must have write permission for several steps in
  this procedure to run correctly.
- A working FreeBSD machine running version 7.0-RELEASE or higher.
- A checkout of the FreeBSD 7.2-STABLE sources.
  This can be your installed /usr/src sources, however it is recommended
  that you keep a backup copy, as certain files need to be modified.
  In the livecd.nano configuration file, the NANO_SRC variable must point
  to the location of your sources. Its value can be overwritten by the
  NANO_SRC environmental variable. In the instructions below it is assumed
  the NANO_SRC environmental variable points to the sources location:

  ### Set the system sources location in sh/bash:
  export NANO_SRC=/usr/src
  ### Set the system sources location in csh/tcsh:
  setenv NANO_SRC /usr/src

- In the XORP CVS repository, the files relative to the other/LiveCD
  directory must be used to overwrite the FreeBSD sources you will be
  building the system from, if you are using a version of the FreeBSD
  sources prior to 7.2-STABLE.

  Please refer to http://www.xorp.org/svn.html for instructions on checking
  out from the XORP repository, before checking out other/LiveCD:
    # svn co http://xorp.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/trunk/other/LiveCD

  Once the sources are checked out, use the following commands to copy
  the LiveCD modifications on top of your FreeBSD sources:
    # cd other/LiveCD
    # tar cf - . | ( cd $NANO_SRC && tar xvf - )

- A pre-built XORP package from the FreeBSD ports collection, net/xorp-devel.
  This may be built by cd'ing to /usr/ports/net/xorp-devel and running
  "make package", however, this will also install XORP on your build system.
  This step is non-optional and is a limitation of the FreeBSD ports system.

  The XORP_PACKAGES and XORP_PACKAGES_DIR variables must be set to point to
  the name of the binary package, and its directory location, respectively.
  Those values can be overwritten by setting the XORP_PACKAGES and
  XORP_PACKAGES_DIR environmental variables.

- If building a LiveCD, install mkisofs:
    # cd /usr/ports/sysutils/cdrtools && make install

- 2 GB of free disk space under /usr/obj (where NanoBSD builds by default).

You will need a CD recorder in order to burn a LiveCD ISO image.

* To run the system based on a XORP Live Image requires an x86 based PC
  with at least 256MB memory. The BIOS must be configured to boot from the
  CD or USB device first (ahead of floppy and hard drives).

 * If using the CD image, a CD-ROM drive and  optionally, a USB disk for
   saving configuration.

 * If using the USB image, a writable USB disk is required.
   A PC with a USB 2.0 capable controller and disk are highly recommended.

The Live Image now uses a multiprocessor kernel; it is backwards compatible
with uniprocessor machines. Most, but not all, network card drivers are
present in the Live Image kernel.


How to use it
=============

XORP's Live Image is delivered as a set of scripts which build on the
existing NanoBSD framework in FreeBSD 7.2.

The nanobsd.sh script is the main tool, used to generate the bootable image.
Additional patches are supplied for LiveCD generation, which are not part
of NanoBSD as shipped in FreeBSD.


nanobsd.sh usage
================

Before using the nanobsd.sh script, you should edit the livecd.nano
config file and set some basic variables in there. Those variables will
define paths, places and files that will be used and/or generated during
the operation.

For detailed usage instructions, please refer to FreeBSD's nanobsd(8)
manual page ('man 8 nanobsd').

Typically one would generate a XORP LiveCD using a command like this
(from scratch):
  # cd $NANO_SRC/tools/tools/nanobsd
  ### If necessary, edit livecd.nano and set variable NANO_SRC as appropriate
  # sh nanobsd.sh -c livecd.nano

If building a XORP LiveUSB disk image, use a command like this:
  # cd $NANO_SRC/tools/tools/nanobsd
  ### If necessary, edit liveusb.nano and set variable NANO_SRC as appropriate
  # sh nanobsd.sh -c liveusb.nano

As refinements are made to the build, the kernel and world steps may
even be omitted when rebuilding an image:
  # sh nanobsd.sh -c livecd.nano -k -w

The generated LiveCD would be in the /usr/obj/nanobsd.livecd
directory and would be named XORP_LiveCD_X.Y.iso where X.Y
is the release version. E.g.:
  /usr/obj/nanobsd.livecd/XORP_LiveCD_1.5.iso

And for a USB disk image:
  /usr/obj/nanobsd.liveusb/XORP_LiveUSB_1.5.img

On FreeBSD, the LiveCD can be burned to a CD with the following command:
  # burncd data XORP_LiveCD_1.5.iso fixate


Notes
=====

Due to the nature of a CDROM-based system, the system RAM is used
heavily. This means that if, for some reason your system's hardware is
not properly tuned or has bad quality memory, you may experience
several problems like core dumps (with signals 10 and 11), computer
freezing, etc. Most of the system will be running under MD (memory
disk), therefore, bad memory behavior also means corrupted files.

One major change from the old XORP LiveCD is that MD is no longer used
for holding XORP program code. Instead, the FreeBSD virtual memory
system is told to 'fault in' the program code from the boot medium at
boot time, as the medium may be too slow for the Router Manager to be
able run the XORP processes within the time-frame it normally expects.

For USB 2.0 disk devices, this delay is not noticeable, however, the
prefaulting behaviour is enabled by default to allow booting from
legacy USB 1.0 devices on older machines, as well as CDROM devices.

This makes more optimal use of system memory -- however -- sufficient
RAM must be present in the system, and a minimum of 256MB is recommended.
