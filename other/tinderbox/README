XORP Tinderbox
==============

The tinderbox is used to build and test xorp on different platforms a
number of times a day and report errors.  A tinderbox control machine
runs the scripts/tinderbox.sh shell program.

Directory structure
===================

scripts/ contains shell scripts for tinderbox.
xorp/ 	 when it exists contains the xorp code and is used for build and 
	 testing

Configuration
=============

Configuration variables appear in scripts/config.  These should be
self explanatory.

The scripts assume host based authentication (.shosts) between the
controlling machine and the build/test clients.  Depending on your ssh
version you may need need ssh-keysign(8) to be setuid on the
controlling machine.
