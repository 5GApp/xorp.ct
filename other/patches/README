This describes some patches to other projects to make them work
better with Xorp.

xorp_ustl.patch
  This patch applies to the uSTL project as of June 14, 2010.
  It has also been submitted upstream in hopes it will be
  incorporated in the official uSTL project:

  git clone git://ustl.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/ustl/ustl

  This patch fixes some limitations in the original uSTL that
  made it hard to use uSTL with Xorp.  There are still some
  issues, but a subset of xorp will compile with uSTL + this
  patch.

  uSTL is a minimal STL library package that is meant to have
  smaller run-time and compile-time memory usage.  It saves a
  small bit (36k out of 8000k)  of compile-time space.  I have
  not tested run-time performance or even functionality at this
  time, but perhaps others will find it useful.  With a bit more
  build system work, uSTL should be able to replace the entire
  libc++ library, which may save significant total system space.
